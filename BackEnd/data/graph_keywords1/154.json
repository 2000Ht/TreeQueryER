A successful MMORPG should engage players and meet their needs to achieve different cate-gories of gratifications. Research on the evolution of player social interaction network and the dynamics of inter-player intimacy could provide insights into players' gratification-oriented behaviors in MMORPGs. Such understanding could in turn guide game designs for better engaging existing players and marketing strategies for attracting newcomers. Conventional dynamic network analysis may help investigate game-based social interactions at the macroscopic level. However, current dynamic network visualization techniques mainly focus on illustrating topological changes of the entire network, which are unsuitable for analyzing player-specific social interactions in the virtual world from an egocentric perspective. In general, game designers and operators find it difficult to analyze the way players with different gratification needs may interact with one another and the consequences on their relationships with direct ties, using a decentralized social graph with complicated time-varying structures. In this paper, we present MMOSeer, a visual analytics system for exploring the evolution of egocentric player intimacy network. MMOSeer focuses on the relationship between a player (ego) and his/her directly-linked friends (alters). We follow a user-centered design process to develop the system with game analysts and apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established algorithms to depict the evolution of intimacy egocentric network. We also derive a centrality change metric to infer how the impact of changes in an ego's interactive behaviors may propagate through the intimacy network, reshaping the structure of the alters' social circles at both micro and macro levels. Finally, we validate the usability of MMOSeer by discovering different user interaction patterns and the corresponding ego-network structural changes in a real-world gameplay dataset from a commercial MMORPG.", "keywords": "H.5.2 {[}INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION]: User Interfaces-Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2017.8031576", "refList": ["10.1108/s0163-239620140000043016", "10.1007/s12110-003-1016-y", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.11", "10.1109/itw.2010.5593358", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.263", "10.1007/978-3-540-85891-1\\_8", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.254", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.142", "10.1089/cpb.2007.0066", "10.1109/iv.2013.57", "10.1109/asonam.2012.39", "10.1145/2556288.2557010", "10.1145/2512938.2512949", "10.1145/2531602.2531642", "10.1016/j.ipm.2011.09.001", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742388", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598415", "10.1080/13691180903266952", "10.1109/infvis.2001.963274", "10.1109/iv.2011.93", "10.1089/cpb.2007.9988", "10.1109/iv.2013.8", "10.1007/bf02289565", "10.5555/2999134.2999195"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/vast.2018.8802415", "title": "Segue: Overviewing Evolution Patterns of Egocentric Networks by Interactive Construction of Spatial Layouts", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Po-Ming Law;Yanhong Wu;Rahul C.

Existing techniques often require analysts to inspect the evolution patterns of ego-networks one after another. In this study, we explore an approach that allows analysts to interactively create spatial layouts in which each dot is a dynamic ego-network. These spatial layouts provide overviews of the evolution patterns of ego-networks, thereby revealing different global patterns such as trends, clusters and outliers in evolution patterns. To let analysts interactively construct interpretable spatial layouts, we propose a data transformation pipeline, with which analysts can adjust the spatial layouts and convert dynamic ego-networks into event sequences to aid interpretations of the spatial positions. Based on this transformation pipeline, we develop Segue, a visual analysis system that supports thorough exploration of the evolution patterns of ego-networks. Through two usage scenarios, we demonstrate how analysts can gain insights into the overall evolution patterns of a large collection of ego-networks by interactively creating different spatial layouts.", "keywords": "Human-centered computing,Visualization,Visualization techniques,Graph drawings", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2018.8802415", "refList": ["10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500099", "10.1007/b98835", "10.1109/vast.2009.5332595", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.226", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01451.x", "10.1145/1514888.1514891", "10.1016/j.socnet.2008.07.001", "10.1073/pnas.021544898", "10.1109/vast.2011.6102449", "10.1109/mcg.2005.102", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.263", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598446", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.254", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744198", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598797", "10.1145/2207676.2207738", "10.1145/2207676.2207741", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2468151", "10.1056/nejmsa066082", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.198", "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031576", "10.1145/2556288.2557010", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467615", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.200", "10.1109/icvrv.2016.88", "10.1109/34.682181", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2465151", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2468078", "10.1145/2512938.2512949", "10.1371/journal.pone.0036250", "10.1109/time.1997.600793", "10.1007/978-1-4757-1904-8", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.188", "10.1016/j.socnet.2008.12.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2383380", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742388", "10.1145/2133416.2146416", "10.1145/2858036.2858488", "10.1007/s13278-013-0123-y", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.78", "10.1109/vast.2015.7347632", "10.1109/mic.2005.114", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467851", "10.1109/vast.2012.6400486", "10.1145/3025453.3025777"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/vast.2018.8802454", "title": "EmbeddingVis: A Visual Analytics Approach to Comparative Network Embedding Inspection", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Quan Li;Kristanto Sean Njotoprawiro;Hammad Haleem;Qiaoan Chen;Chris Yi;Xiaojuan Ma", "citationCount": "2", "affiliation": "Li, Q (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Univ Sci \\& Technol, Dept Comp Sci \\& Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

However, despite the high efficiency and accuracy of learning an embedding model, people have little clue of what information about the original network is preserved in the embedding vectors. The abstractness of low-dimensional vector representation, stochastic nature of the construction process, and non-transparent hyper-parameters all obscure understanding of network embedding results. Visualization techniques have been introduced to facilitate embedding vector inspection, usually by projecting the embedding space to a two-dimensional display. Although the existing visualization methods allow simple examination of the structure of embedding space, they cannot support in-depth exploration of the embedding vectors. In this paper, we design an exploratory visual analytics system that supports the comparative visual interpretation of embedding vectors at the cluster, instance, and structural levels. To be more specific, it facilitates comparison of what and how node metrics are preserved across different embedding models and investigation of relationships between node metrics and selected embedding vectors. Several case studies confirm the efficacy of our system.
