They try to reconstruct the tectonic settings where these rocks were formed and the history of events that affected them through the geological time. The spinel group minerals provide useful information regarding the geological environment in which the host rocks were formed. They constitute excellent indicators of geological environments (tectonic settings) and are of invaluable help in the search for mineral deposits of economic interest. The current workflow requires the scientists to work with different applications to analyze spine data. They do use specific diagrams, but these are usually not interactive. The current workflow hinders domain experts to fully exploit the potentials of tediously and expensively collected data. In this paper, we introduce the Spinel Explorer-an interactive visual analysis application for spinel group minerals. The design of the Spinel Explorer and of the newly introduced interactions is a result of a careful study of geologists' tasks. The Spinel Explorer includes most of the diagrams commonly used for analyzing spinel group minerals, including 2D binary plots, ternary plots, and 3D Spinel prism plots. Besides specific plots, conventional information visualization views are also integrated in the Spinel Explorer. All views are interactive and linked. The Spinel Explorer supports conventional statistics commonly used in spinel minerals exploration. The statistics views and different data derivation techniques are fully integrated in the system. Besides the Spinel Explorer as newly proposed interactive exploration system, we also describe the identified analysis tasks, and propose a new workflow. We evaluate the Spinel Explorer using real-life data from two locations in Argentina: the Frontal Cordillera in Central Andes and Patagonia. We describe the new findings of the geologists which would have been much more difficult to achieve using the current workflow only. Very positive feedback from geologists confirms the usefulness of the Spinel Explorer.", "keywords": "Interactive visual analysis, visualization in earth/space/ and environmental sciences, coordinated and multiple views, design studies", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346754", "refList": ["10.1007/978-3-540-70956-5", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.111", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1016/j.cageo.2012.05.003", "10.1109/visual.1995.485139", "10.1016/s0167-9473(02)00286-4", "10.1109/cmv.2007.20", "10.1093/petrology/egl013", "10.1145/345513.345271", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.155", "10.1093/petrology/42.12.2279", "10.1145/1247480.1247623", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.99", "10.1057/palgrave/ivs/9500006", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03116.x", "10.1109/2945.981851", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.110", "10.1007/bf01898350"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/vast.2015.7347676", "title": "Interactive semi-automatic categorization for spinel group minerals", "year": "2015", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Maria Luj\u00e1n Ganuza;Maria Florencia Gargiulo;Gabriela Ferracutti;Silvia Mabel Castro;Ernesto A.

In 2001, Barnes and Roeder defined a set of contours corresponding to compositional fields for spinel group minerals. Geologists typically use this contours to estimate the tectonic environment where a particular spinel composition could have been formed. This task is prone to errors and requires tedious manual comparison of overlapping diagrams. We introduce a semi-automatic, interactive detection of tectonic settings for an arbitrary dataset based on the Barnes and Roeder contours. The new approach integrates the mentioned contours and includes a novel interaction called contour brush.

Though this problem is NP-hard, we show that rotating the squares by 45 degrees into diamonds allows for a linear or convex quadratic program. It is thus efficiently solvable even for relatively large instances. This positive result and the flexibility offered by constraint programming allow us to study various trade-offs for overlap removal. Specifically, we model and evaluate through computational experiments the relations between displacement, scale and order constraints for static data, and between displacement and temporal coherence for time-varying data. Finally, we also explore the generalization of our methodology to other shapes.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13722", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2015.2424878", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.165", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03106.x", "10.1109/pacificvis.2013.6596123", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346754", "10.1016/s0925-7721(99)00005-x", "10.1137/s0097539702402676", "10.1023/a:1022371615202", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598542", "10.1111/cgf.13199", "10.1007/s00453-009-9281-8", "10.1016/j.dam.2004.02.018", "10.1016/0012-365x(90)90358-o", "10.1137/0405033", "10.1109/sibgrapi.2013.25", "10.1142/s0218195915500077"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 5}, "index": 403, "embedding": [1.3090380430221558, 0.21041083335876465, -0.46709179878234863, 1.1454299688339233, 0.6315125823020935, 0.16650904715061188, -0.7167134881019592, 1.2342313528060913, 1.504316806793213, 0.09749588370323181, 1.4219505786895752, 0.5264315009117126, 1.099421739578247, 0.4436732232570648, -0.6648035645484924, -0.452322781085968, 0.5704052448272705, 0.0788058489561081, 0.06284797191619873, 0.8718135952949524, -0.06630208343267441, -0.5859289169311523, -0.42555859684944153, 0.021193820983171463, -2.011925220489502, 0.14331117272377014, -0.5328229665756226, -0.17058739066123962, 1.227582573890686, -1.7848573923110962, 0.35739079117774963, -0.03441797196865082], "projection": [-0.3691199719905853, 6.730043411254883], "size": 3, "height": 2, "width": 2}
