The original definition of a storyline visualization requires data defined in terms of explicit interaction groups. Relaxing this definition allows storyline visualization to be applied more generally, but this creates questions about how the y-coordinate should encode interactions when this is tied to a particular place or state. To answer this question, we conducted a design study where we considered two layout algorithm design alternatives within a geo-temporal analysis tool written to solve part of the VAST Challenge 2014. We measured the performance of users at overview and detail oriented tasks between two storyline layout algorithms. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first work to question the design principles for storyline visualization, and what we found surprised us. For overview tasks with the alternative layout, which has a consistent encoding for the y-coordinate, users performed moderately better (p &lt;; .05) than the storyline layout based on existing design constraints and aesthetic criteria. Our empirical findings were also supported by first-hand accounts taken from interviews with multiple expert analysts, who suggested that the inconsistent meaning of the y-axis was misleading. These findings led us to design a new storyline layout algorithm that is a \u201cbest of both\u201d where the y-axis has a consistent meaning but aesthetic criteria (e.g., line crossings) are considered.", "keywords": "Storyline visualization,layout algorithms,interaction context,geospatial analysis,VAST Challenge", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2017.8585487", "refList": ["10.1109/32.221135", "10.1038/nrn3475", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2392771", "10.1109/vast.2009.5332593", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.212", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.254", "10.1371/journal.pone.0008694", "10.1007/978-3-319-50106-2\\_29", "10.1007/bf01187020", "10.1207/s15516709cog0000\\_29", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2468151", "10.1016/0020-0190(93)90079-o", "10.1109/etvis.2016.7851163", "10.1109/iv.2002.1028770", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2465151", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2388208", "10.1016/s0166-218x(02)00205-6", "10.1007/978-3-319-47880-7\\_19", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.196", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01955.x", "10.1111/cgf.12512", "10.1145/2858036.2858488", "10.1037/h0031322", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346919", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346433"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030367", "title": "Lyra 2: Designing Interactive Visualizations by Demonstration", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Jonathan Zong;Dhiraj Barnwal;Rupayan Neogy;Arvind Satyanarayan", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Zong, J (Corresponding Author), MIT, Cambridge, MA 02139 USA.

To author interactive visualizations, users must instead turn to textual specification, but such approaches impose a higher technical burden. To bridge this gap, we introduce Lyra 2, a system that extends a prior visualization design environment with novel methods for authoring interaction techniques by demonstration. Users perform an interaction (e.g., button clicks, drags, or key presses) directly on the visualization they are editing. The system interprets this performance using a set of heuristics and enumerates suggestions of possible interaction designs. These heuristics account for the properties of the interaction (e.g., target and event type) as well as the visualization (e.g., mark and scale types, and multiple views). Interaction design suggestions are displayed as thumbnails; users can preview and test these suggestions, iteratively refine them through additional demonstrations, and finally apply and customize them via property inspectors. We evaluate our approach through a gallery of diverse examples, and evaluate its usability through a first-use study and via an analysis of its cognitive dimensions. We find that, in Lyra 2, interaction design by demonstration enables users to rapidly express a wide range of interactive visualizations.", "keywords": "Direct manipulation,interactive visualization,interaction design by demonstration", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030367", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934396", "10.1613/jair.301", "10.1016/j.automatica.2009.07.008", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.12.001", "10.1016/j.neucom.2007.11.026", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2392771", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934798", "10.1613/jair.3912", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.212", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816203", "10.1111/cgf.13193", "10.1109/21.87055", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864899", "10.1016/j.visinf.2017.11.002", "10.1007/s11432-018-9801-4", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.196", "10.1145/302979.303030", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.191", "10.1007/978-3-642-36955-1\\_16", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585487", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1038/nature14236", "10.1145/568522.568523", "10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.04.011", "10.1109/iccv.2019.00880", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030467", "title": "PlotThread: Creating Expressive Storyline Visualizations using Reinforcement Learning", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Tan Tang;Renzhong Li;Xinke Wu;Shuhan Liu;Johannes Knittel;Steffen Koch;Lingyun Yu;Peiran Ren;Thomas Ertl;Yingcai Wu", "citationCount": "1", "affiliation": "Wu, YC (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Univ, Zhejiang Lab, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.

However, the design of storyline visualizations is a difficult task as users need to balance between aesthetic goals and narrative constraints. Despite that the optimization-based methods have been improved significantly in terms of producing aesthetic and legible layouts, the existing (semi-) automatic methods are still limited regarding 1) efficient exploration of the storyline design space and 2) flexible customization of storyline layouts. In this work, we propose a reinforcement learning framework to train an AI agent that assists users in exploring the design space efficiently and generating well-optimized storylines. Based on the framework, we introduce PlotThread, an authoring tool that integrates a set of flexible interactions to support easy customization of storyline visualizations. To seamlessly integrate the AI agent into the authoring process, we employ a mixed-initiative approach where both the agent and designers work on the same canvas to boost the collaborative design of storylines. We evaluate the reinforcement learning model through qualitative and quantitative experiments and demonstrate the usage of PlotThread using a collection of use cases.", "keywords": "Storyline visualization,reinforcement learning,mixed-initiative design", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030467", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934396", "10.1613/jair.301", "10.1016/j.automatica.2009.07.008", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.12.001", "10.1016/j.neucom.2007.11.026", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2392771", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934798", "10.1613/jair.3912", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.212", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816203", "10.1111/cgf.13193", "10.1109/21.87055", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864899", "10.1016/j.visinf.2017.11.002", "10.1007/s11432-018-9801-4", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.196", "10.1145/302979.303030", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.191", "10.1007/978-3-642-36955-1\\_16", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585487", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1038/nature14236", "10.1145/568522.568523", "10.1016/j.neunet.2014.09.003", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.04.011", "10.1109/iccv.2019.00880", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 5}, "index": 1188, "embedding": [1.3156616687774658, 1.2409378290176392, 1.2060009241104126, 1.930429220199585, -0.6737499833106995, 0.16650904715061188, -0.7139257192611694, 2.0853636264801025, -0.4176805317401886, -0.8176287412643433, 0.36123162508010864, 1.6463929414749146, -0.13027368485927582, 3.449157238006592, 1.7055219411849976, 1.3806899785995483, 0.7226794958114624, 0.07420150190591812, -0.6413080096244812, -1.0321691036224365, -0.06630208343267441, 1.4915298223495483, 0.8804308176040649, -0.13057257235050201, 1.7855898141860962, 0.09751410037279129, -0.5483691096305847, 0.9807895421981812, 2.193897008895874, 0.08851666003465652, 1.1623769998550415, 1.9071029424667358], "projection": [-4.185153961181641, 7.834157943725586], "size": 3, "height": 2, "width": 2}
