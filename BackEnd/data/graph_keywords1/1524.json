However, existing zoomable UI toolkits such as Pad++ and ZVTM do not provide the backend database support and data-driven primitives that are necessary for creating large-scale visualizations. This limitation in existing general-purpose toolkits has led to many purpose-built solutions (e.g. Google Maps and ForeCache) that address the issue of scalability but cannot be easily extended to support visualizations beyond their intended data types and usage scenarios. In this paper, we introduce Kyrix to ease the process of creating general and large-scale web-based pan/zoom visualizations. Kyrix is an integrated system that provides the developer with a concise and expressive declarative language along with a backend support for performance optimization of large-scale data. To evaluate the scalability of Kyrix, we conducted a set of benchmarked experiments and show that Kyrix can support high interactivity (with an average latency of 100 ms or below) on pan/zoom visualizations of 100 million data points. We further demonstrate the accessibility of Kyrix through an observational study with 8 developers. Results indicate that developers can quickly learn Kyrix's underlying declarative model to create scalable pan/zoom visualizations. Finally, we provide a gallery of visualizations and show that Kyrix is expressive and flexible in that it can support the developer in creating a wide range of customized visualizations across different application domains and data types.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13708", "refList": ["10.1145/1142473.1142560", "10.1145/2882903.2882919", "10.1145/1167838.1167860", "10.1111/cgf.12129", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346452", "10.1117/12.648609", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1109/bigdata.2013.6691708", "10.1109/vast.2008.4677357", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598624", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249019", "10.1145/1556262.1556289", "10.1145/230562.230577", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70535", "10.1145/2254556.2254599", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249021", "10.1109/vlhcc.2005.11", "10.1111/cgf.12391", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467091", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.84", "10.1145/2556288.2557195", "10.1145/1095034.1095059", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.179", "10.1109/2945.981851", "10.1017/s1743921316012795", "10.1186/s13059-018-1486-1", "10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030443", "title": "CAVA: A Visual Analytics System for Exploratory Columnar Data Augmentation Using Knowledge Graphs", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Dylan Cashman;Shenyu Xu;Subhajit Das;Florian Heimerl;Cong Liu;Shah Rukh Humayoun;Michael Gleicher;Alex Endert;Remco Chang", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Cashman, D (Corresponding Author), Tufts Univ, Medford, MA 02155 USA.

Such separation of data construction from analysis precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise in-situ during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data analysis tasks can limit the pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation and data augmentation with the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset is difficult because it requires human knowledge to determine which available attributes will be helpful for the ensuing analytical tasks. CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual analytics can help users forage for attributes by letting users visually explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface for query construction. It also provides visualizations of the knowledge graph itself to help users understand complex joins such as multi-hop aggregations. We assess the ability of our system to enable users to perform complex data combinations without programming in a user study over two datasets. We then demonstrate the generalizability of CAVA through two additional usage scenarios. The results of the evaluation confirm that CAVA is effective in helping the user perform data foraging that leads to improved analysis outcomes, and offer evidence in support of integrating data augmentation as a part of the visual analytics pipeline.", "keywords": "Visual Analytics,Information Foraging,Data Augmentation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030443", "refList": ["10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500122", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598867", "10.1111/cgf.13708", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934799", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934541", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.65", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2875702", "10.1109/iv.2004.1320207", "10.1068/p260471", "10.1145/1778765.1778816", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2808489", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864912", "10.1016/j.apgeog.2015.12.006", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01960.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864843", "10.1109/pacificvis.2010.5429604", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346898", "10.1109/5.726791", "10.1177/1475090214540874", "10.1109/icde.2016.7498287", "10.1145/1556262.1556289", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70535", "10.1109/vast.2012.6400489", "10.1145/1056808.1056914", "10.1016/j.neucom.2014.09.063", "10.1145/7529.8927", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598495", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2607204", "10.1109/vast47406.2019.8986943", "10.3758/bf03205986", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532142", "10.1145/1150402.1150479", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2674978", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2945960", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744098", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2674999", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.279", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346594", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744184", "10.1111/cgf.12876", "10.1007/s4095-020-0191-7", "10.1007/s11390-015-1535-0", "10.1111/cgf.12640", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598667", "10.1111/cgf.13683", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.153", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934208", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934655", "10.1111/cgf.12655", "10.1007/s11023-010-9221-z", "10.1109/vast.2012.6400487", "10.1145/2702123.2702585", "10.1007/bf00310175", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744378", "10.1103/physreve.64.061907", "10.1109/ldav.2017.8231848", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030430", "title": "Competing Models: Inferring Exploration Patterns and Information Relevance via Bayesian Model Selection", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Shayan Monadjemi;Roman Garnett;Alvitta Ottley", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Monadjemi, S (Corresponding Author), Washington Univ, St Louis, MO 14263 USA.

The first step for intelligent response in visualizations is to enable computers to infer user goals and strategies through observing their interactions with a system. Researchers have proposed multiple techniques to model users, however, their frameworks often depend on the visualization design, interaction space, and dataset. Due to these dependencies, many techniques do not provide a general algorithmic solution to user exploration modeling. In this paper, we construct a series of models based on the dataset and pose user exploration modeling as a Bayesian model selection problem where we maintain a belief over numerous competing models that could explain user interactions. Each of these competing models represent an exploration strategy the user could adopt during a session. The goal of our technique is to make high-level and in-depth inferences about the user by observing their low-level interactions. Although our proposed idea is applicable to various probabilistic model spaces, we demonstrate a specific instance of encoding exploration patterns as competing models to infer information relevance. We validate our technique's ability to infer exploration bias, predict future interactions, and summarize an analytic session using user study datasets. Our results indicate that depending on the application, our method outperforms established baselines for bias detection and future interaction prediction. Finally, we discuss future research directions based on our proposed modeling paradigm and suggest how practitioners can use this method to build intelligent visualization systems that understand users' goals and adapt to improve the exploration process.", "keywords": "User Interaction Modeling,Bayesian Machine Learning", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030430", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865141", "10.1145/355588.365140", "10.1007/978-0-387-98141-3\\_1", "10.1145/2882903.2882919", "10.1111/cgf.13708", "10.1145/3183713.3183738", "10.1111/cgf.12129", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346452", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.65", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249018", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2671341", "10.1109/infvis.2002.1173156", "10.1109/38.974515", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598624", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249019", "10.1145/1556262.1556289", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70535", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.161", "10.1109/ldav.2015.7348077", "10.1109/iv.2004.1320190", "10.1145/3139958.3140037", "10.1109/vlhcc.2005.11", "10.1145/98524.98564", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346594", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.84", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744184", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.179", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00283-2", "10.14778/2428536.2428538", "10.1109/icde.2014.6816720", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2785807", "10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2754480"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030432", "title": "Evaluation of Sampling Methods for Scatterplots", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Jun Yuan;Shouxing Xiang;Jiazhi Xia;Lingyun Yu;Shixia Liu", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Liu, SX (Corresponding Author), Tsinghua Univ, BNRist, Beijing, Peoples R China.
