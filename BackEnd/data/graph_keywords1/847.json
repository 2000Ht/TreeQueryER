The early stages of collaborations are typically time consuming for all stakeholders as researchers piece together an understanding of domain challenges from disparate discussions and meetings. A number of recent projects, however, report on the use of creative visualization-opportunities (CVO) workshops to accelerate the early stages of applied work, eliciting a wealth of requirements in a few days of focused work. Yet, there is no established guidance for how to use such workshops effectively. In this paper, we present the results of a 2-year collaboration in which we analyzed the use of 17 workshops in 10 visualization contexts. Its primary contribution is a framework for CVO workshops that: 1) identifies a process model for using workshops; 2) describes a structure of what happens within effective workshops; 3) recommends 25 actionable guidelines for future workshops; and 4) presents an example workshop and workshop methods. The creation of this framework exemplifies the use of critical reflection to learn about visualization in practice from diverse studies and experience.", "keywords": "User-centered visualization design,design studies,creativity workshops,critically reflective practice", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865241", "refList": ["10.1007/bf00988593", "10.1145/3064663.3064692", "10.1109/ms.2012.171", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744459", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.132", "10.1207/s15324834basp1201\\_1", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346331", "10.1109/re.2008.54", "10.1145/1013115.1013132", "10.1109/tvcg.2004.1260759", "10.1109/re.2010.16", "10.1145/2598510.2598564", "10.1017/cbo9780511807916.022", "10.1002/chp.1340180402", "10.1037/h0026747", "10.1145/2598784.2598806", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.209", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599338", "10.1080/15710880701875068", "10.1145/2598510.2598566", "10.1145/1900441.1900476", "10.1191/1478088706qp063oa", "10.1109/iv.2011.32", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.279", "10.1145/2993901.2993916", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467271", "10.1145/1168149.1168158", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.191", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1111/1467-8691.00101", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.145", "10.1287/orsc.1060.0200", "10.1111/cgf.12635", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467191", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1017/cbo9780511807916.024", "10.1111/cgf.13184", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599030", "10.1017/cbo9780511807916.009", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598545"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "title": "Criteria for Rigor in Visualization Design Study", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Miriah D.

From this interpretivist position we explore the nature of visualization design study and develop six criteria for rigor. We propose that rigor is established and judged according to the extent to which visualization design study research and its reporting are INFORMED, REFLEXIVE, ABUNDANT, PLAUSIBLE, RESONANT, and TRANSPARENT. This perspective and the criteria were constructed through a four-year engagement with the discourse around rigor and the nature of knowledge in social science, information systems, and design. We suggest methods from cognate disciplines that can support visualization researchers in meeting these criteria during the planning, execution, and reporting of design study. Through a series of deliberately provocative questions, we explore implications of this new perspective for design study research in visualization, concluding that as a discipline, visualization is not yet well positioned to embrace, nurture, and fully benefit from a rigorous, interpretivist approach to design study.

We then discuss the advantages and limitations of each technique.

Computational tools, such as dimensionality reduction (DR) and classification, are commonly used to efficiently process the multidimensional space of features. These underlying calculations often hinder interpretability of results and prevent experts from assessing the impact of individual molecular features on the resulting representations. To provide a solution for scrutinizing such complex data, we introduce ChemVA, an interactive application for the visual exploration of large molecular ensembles and their features. Our tool consists of multiple coordinated views: Hexagonal view, Detail view, 3D view, Table view, and a newly proposed Difference view designed for the comparison of DR projections. These views display DR projections combined with biological activity, selected molecular features, and confidence scores for each of these projections. This conjunction of views allows the user to drill down through the dataset and to efficiently select candidate compounds. Our approach was evaluated on two case studies of finding structurally similar ligands with similar binding affinity to a target protein, as well as on an external qualitative evaluation. The results suggest that our system allows effective visual inspection and comparison of different high-dimensional molecular representations. Furthermore, ChemVA assists in the identification of candidate compounds while providing information on the certainty behind different molecular representations.", "keywords": "Virtual screening,visual analysis,dimensionality reduction,coordinated views,cheminformatics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030438", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2008.137", "10.1057/ivs.2009.10", "10.2312/eurovisstar.20151110", "10.1109/eisic.2015.35", "10.1109/pacificvis.2014.44", "10.1145/1142473.1142574", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.223", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346573", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.1111/cgf.13717", "10.1109/vizsec.2009.5375536", "10.1111/cgf.12925", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467551", "10.1109/mcg.2015.99", "10.1007/978-3-319", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.255", "10.1145/1064830.1064834", "10.1177/1473871611433713", "10.1207/s1532690xci0804\\_2", "10.1145/1168149.1168168", "10.1016/j.chb.2006.10.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346441", "10.1109/eisic.2017.15", "10.1111/1467-8721.00160", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865024", "10.1109/infvis.2004.2"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030435", "title": "Data Visceralization: Enabling Deeper Understanding of Data Using Virtual Reality", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Benjamin Lee;Dave Brown;Bongshin Lee;Christophe Hurter;Steven Mark Drucker;Tim Dwyer", "citationCount": "1", "affiliation": "Lee, B (Corresponding Author), Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.

While this abstraction is a powerful basis for data visualization, the connection between the representation and the original underlying data (i.e., what the quantities and measurements actually correspond with in reality) can be lost. On the other hand, virtual reality (VR) is being increasingly used to represent real and abstract models as natural experiences to users. In this work, we explore the potential of using VR to help restore the basic understanding of units and measures that are often abstracted away in data visualization in an approach we call data visceralization. By building VR prototypes as design probes, we identify key themes and factors for data visceralization. We do this first through a critical reflection by the authors, then by involving external participants. We find that data visceralization is an engaging way of understanding the qualitative aspects of physical measures and their real-life form, which complements analytical and quantitative understanding commonly gained from data visualization.

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game - one with narrative elements and one without - and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game.

In this paper we introduce and define a new methodological paradigm we call design by immersion, which provides an alternative perspective on problem-driven visualization work. Design by immersion embeds transdisciplinary experiences at the center of the visualization process by having visualization researchers participate in the work of the target domain (or domain experts participate in visualization research). Based on our own combined experiences of working on cross-disciplinary, problem-driven visualization projects, we present six case studies that expose the opportunities that design by immersion enables, including (1) exploring new domain-inspired visualization design spaces, (2) enriching domain understanding through personal experiences, and (3) building strong transdisciplinary relationships. Furthermore, we illustrate how the process of design by immersion opens up a diverse set of design activities that can be combined in different ways depending on the type of collaboration, project, and goals. Finally, we discuss the challenges and potential pitfalls of design by immersion.", "keywords": "Visualization,problem-driven,design studies,collaboration,methodology,framework", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934790", "refList": ["10.1177/0020872808093347", "10.1080/15313220802033310", "10.2307/1318716", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346331", "10.1145/2669557.2669564", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346323", "10.1145/2317956.2318034", "10.1039/c4cp02959c", "10.1177/1473871615621602", "10.1145/3173574.3174212", "10.1109/mcg.2013.101", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.122", "10.1021/acs.jctc.5b00783", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467452", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.209", "10.1109/beliv.2018.8634026", "10.16995/olh.282", "10.1145/1900441.1900476", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467271", "10.1145/2993901.2993916", "10.1016/j.puhe.2015.10.030", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865241", "10.1177/1473871611415996", "10.1093/llc/fqy051", "10.1145/1168149.1168158", "10.1111/cgf.12873", "10.2312/eurovisshort.20151137", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.160", "10.1080/10494820.2019.1570279", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1109/mcg.2006.120", "10.1145/1377966.1377974", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346325", "10.1111/cgf.12936", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1201/9781410615862.ch54", "10.1109/pacificvis.2010.5429611"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3029413", "title": "A Design Space of Vision Science Methods for Visualization Research", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Madison A.

These efforts provide scientific grounding to complement design intuitions, leading to more effective visualization practice. However, published visualization research currently reflects a limited set of available methods for understanding how people process visualized data. Alternative methods from vision science offer a rich suite of tools for understanding visualizations, but no curated collection of these methods exists in either perception or visualization research. We introduce a design space of experimental methods for empirically investigating the perceptual processes involved with viewing data visualizations to ultimately inform visualization design guidelines. This paper provides a shared lexicon for facilitating experimental visualization research. We discuss popular experimental paradigms, adjustment types, response types, and dependent measures used in vision science research, rooting each in visualization examples. We then discuss the advantages and limitations of each technique. Researchers can use this design space to create innovative studies and progress scientific understanding of design choices and evaluations in visualization. We highlight a history of collaborative success between visualization and vision science research and advocate for a deeper relationship between the two fields that can elaborate on and extend the methodological design space for understanding visualization and vision.", "keywords": "Perception,human vision,empirical research,evaluation,HCI", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3029413", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934790", "10.1177/146879410200200205", "10.2312/eurovisshort", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467811", "10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00859.x", "10.1177/1473871613510429", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864836", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865076", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.231", "10.1002/cphy.c100079", "10.1177/0886109909354981", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865149", "10.1080/1750984x.2017.1317357", "10.1007/978-3-7643-8472-2\\_6", "10.1093/bioinformatics/btq110", "10.1111/cgf.13728", "10.2307/1511837", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.3233/efi-2004-22201", "10.1002/chp.1340180402", "10.1111/2041-210x.12034", "10.1111/j.2041-210x.2011.00169.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467452", "10.1002/chp", "10.1177/1077800410383121", "10.1177/1744987107081254", "10.1002/cpbi.96", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864526", "10.1109/beliv.2018.8634026", "10.2307/1511637", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346431", "10.1111/cgf.12883", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934281", "10.1145/2993901.2993916", "10.2307/3178066", "10.1145/2993901.2993913", "10.1145/1182475.1182476", "10.1016/j.destud.2004.06.002", "10.1177/1609406918763214", "10.2312/eurovisshort.20151137", "10.1145/882262.882291", "10.1177/174498710501000305", "10.1017/s1049096513001789", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1093/nar/gkz239", "10.1093/sysbio/sys062", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2898186", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2811488", "10.1007/s11135-006-9044-4", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1111/2041-210x.12066", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2874523", "10.1177/1609406920909938"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030405", "title": "Insights From Experiments With Rigor in an EvoBio Design Study", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Jennifer Rogers;Austin H.

The result is an abundance of reported insights into visualization design, with an emphasis on novel visualization techniques and systems as the primary contribution of these studies. In recent work we proposed a new, interpretivist perspective on design study and six companion criteria for rigor that highlight the opportunities for researchers to contribute knowledge that extends beyond visualization idioms and software. In this work we conducted a year-long collaboration with evolutionary biologists to develop an interactive tool for visual exploration of multivariate datasets and phylogenetic trees. During this design study we experimented with methods to support three of the rigor criteria: ABUNDANT, REFLEXIVE, and TRANSPARENT. As a result we contribute two novel visualization techniques for the analysis of multivariate phylogenetic datasets, three methodological recommendations for conducting design studies drawn from reflections over our process of experimentation, and two writing devices for reporting interpretivist design study.

While this abstraction is a powerful basis for data visualization, the connection between the representation and the original underlying data (i.e., what the quantities and measurements actually correspond with in reality) can be lost. On the other hand, virtual reality (VR) is being increasingly used to represent real and abstract models as natural experiences to users. In this work, we explore the potential of using VR to help restore the basic understanding of units and measures that are often abstracted away in data visualization in an approach we call data visceralization. By building VR prototypes as design probes, we identify key themes and factors for data visceralization. We do this first through a critical reflection by the authors, then by involving external participants. We find that data visceralization is an engaging way of understanding the qualitative aspects of physical measures and their real-life form, which complements analytical and quantitative understanding commonly gained from data visualization. However, data visceralization is most effective when there is a one-to-one mapping between data and representation, with transformations such as scaling affecting this understanding.
