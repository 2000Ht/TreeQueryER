In unsteady vector field analysis, researchers recently directed their attention towards the computation of near-steady reference frames for vortex extraction, which is a numerically challenging endeavor. In this paper, we utilize a convolutional neural network to combine two steps of the visualization pipeline in an end-to-end manner: the filtering and the feature extraction. We use neural networks for the extraction of a steady reference frame for a given unsteady 2D vector field. By conditioning the neural network to noisy inputs and resampling artifacts, we obtain numerically stabler results than existing optimization-based approaches. Supervised deep learning typically requires a large amount of training data. Thus, our second contribution is the creation of a vector field benchmark data set, which is generally useful for any local deep learning-based feature extraction. Based on Vatistas velocity profile, we formulate a parametric vector field mixture model that we parameterize based on numerically-computed example vector fields in near-steady reference frames. Given the parametric model, we can efficiently synthesize thousands of vector fields that serve as input to our deep learning architecture. The proposed network is evaluated on an unseen numerical fluid flow simulation.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13689", "refList": ["10.1016/0377-0257(79)87004-4", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864828", "10.1016/0167-2789(91)90088-q", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_9", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1111/cgf.13405", "10.1111/cgf.13319", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2843369", "10.1007/bf00538235", "10.23940/ijpe.18.03", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1146/annurev.fluid.23.1.601", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1036", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864839", "10.1007/978-3-319-54024-5\\_6", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.189", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467203", "10.2514/2.957", "10.1016/0960-0779(94)90137-6", "10.1109/visual.1991.175773", "10.1109/visual.1996.568137", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1109/pacificvis.2016.7465253", "10.1007/bf00849110", "10.1007/bf00198434", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.3390/informatics4030027", "10.1137/140983665", "10.1016/0011-7471(70)90059-8", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1145/1183287.1183290"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3028947", "title": "A Fluid Flow Data Set for Machine Learning and its Application to Neural Flow Map Interpolation", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Jakob Jakob;Markus H.

In this paper, we construct a large fluid flow data set and apply it to a deep learning problem in scientific visualization. Parameterized by the Reynolds number, the data set contains a wide spectrum of laminar and turbulent fluid flow regimes. The full data set was simulated on a high-performance compute cluster and contains 8000 time-dependent 2D vector fields, accumulating to more than 16 TB in size. Using our public fluid data set, we trained deep convolutional neural networks in order to set a benchmark for an improved post-hoc Lagrangian fluid flow analysis.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.", "keywords": "Deep neural network,3D cerebrovascular segmentation and visualization,maximum intensity projection (MIP),joint embedding", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030374", "refList": ["10.1109/cluster.2018.00036", "10.1109/iccv.2015.123", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.133", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.19", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934312", "10.1007/978-3-319-46487-9\\_40", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.175", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70523", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2880207", "10.1145/3309993", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00018", "10.1109/iccv.2017.244", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.632", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816059", "10.1109/pacificvis.2009.4906852", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864808", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2881523", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467431", "10.1109/tpami.2015.2439281", "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.8737", "10.1109/cvpr.2019.00244", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.165", "10.1109/bigdata.2018.8622520", "10.1007/978-3-319-46466-4\\_29", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933759", "10.1145/3197517.3201304", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742378", "10.1109/cvpr.2006.91", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742369", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934255", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4\\_28", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00041", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934332", "10.1109/cvpr.2018.00916", "10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6\\_43"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}], "len": 7}, "index": 1505, "embedding": [0.9572479128837585, 1.2069056034088135, 1.2694976329803467, 0.6669526100158691, -0.6602144837379456, 0.16650904715061188, -0.706787109375, 0.7177391648292542, -0.43060755729675293, -0.8515991568565369, 0.12957310676574707, 1.3607707023620605, -0.13366082310676575, 2.2754101753234863, 1.6746678352355957, 1.0331006050109863, 1.3820443153381348, 0.06482167541980743, -0.6607173681259155, -0.5945855975151062, -0.06630208343267441, -0.11520926654338837, 0.49506306648254395, -0.1414090394973755, 0.087181955575943, 0.08472851663827896, -0.5077023506164551, 1.22401762008667, 1.5802918672561646, 0.005224849097430706, 1.405979871749878, 1.6512386798858643], "projection": [-4.310144424438477, 7.689224720001221], "size": 4, "height": 3, "width": 2}
