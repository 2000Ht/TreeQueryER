In this paper, we present the first machine learning approach for predicting human preference for graph layouts.\nIn general, the data sets with human preference labels are limited and insufficient for training deep networks. To address this, we train our deep learning model by employing the transfer learning method, e.g., exploiting the quality metrics, such as shape-based metrics, edge crossing and stress, which are shown to be correlated to human preference on graph layouts. Experimental results using the ground truth human preference data sets show that our model can successfully predict human preference for graph layouts. To our best knowledge, this is the first approach for predicting qualitative evaluation of graph layouts using human preference experiment data.", "doi": "amachinelearningappr-2021", "year": 2021, "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "citationCount": 0, "keywords": "", "link": "", "refList": "", "wos": 0, "len": 1}, "index": 1612, "embedding": [-1.9514179229736328, -0.26493993401527405, -1.059349536895752, -0.3480980396270752, -0.3121996223926544, 0.16650904715061188, 4.804631233215332, 1.22976815700531, 5.3700761795043945, -0.6374728679656982, 1.9450945854187012, -1.0641764402389526, 0.06583120673894882, 1.8442310094833374, -0.7106465697288513, -0.5486658811569214, -0.17872647941112518, 0.07991757988929749, -0.2869078516960144, 0.48070228099823, -0.06630208343267441, 0.5107607245445251, -0.10843748599290848, -0.13207590579986572, -1.3927513360977173, 2.2763984203338623, -0.5399249196052551, -0.17674389481544495, -0.5434138178825378, -2.582859516143799, 0.136640727519989, -0.9124329686164856], "projection": [-8.34006404876709, 22.71348762512207], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
