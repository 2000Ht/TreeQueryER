Delays can lead to missing a connecting train at the transfer station, or to coming too late to an appointment at the destination. Facing this uncertainty, the traveler may wish to use an earlier train or a different connection arriving well before the appointment. Currently, train trip planning is based on scheduled times of connections between two stations. Information about approximate delays is only available shortly before train departure. Although several visualization approaches can show temporal uncertainty, we are not aware of any visual design specifically supporting trip planning, which can show delay uncertainty and its impact on the connections. We propose and evaluate a visual design which extends train trip planning with delay uncertainty. It shows the scheduled train connections together with their expected train delays as well as their impacts on both the arrival time, and the potential of missing a transfer. The visualization also includes information about alternative connections in case of these critical transfers. In this way the user is able to judge which train connection is suitable for a trip. We conducted a user study with 76 participants to evaluate our design. We compared it to two alternative presentations that are prominent in Germany. The study showed that our design performs comparably well for tasks concerning train schedules. The additional uncertainty display as well as the visualization of alternative connections was appreciated and well understood. The participants were able to estimate when they would likely arrive at their destination despite possible train delays while they were unable to estimate this with existing presentations. The users would prefer to use the new design for their trip planning.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13190", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2008.141", "10.1111/cgf.12113", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2468111", "10.1179/1743277414y.0000000099", "10.1037/1082-989x.4.3.243", "10.1145/2993901.2993919", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346893", "10.1007/978-3-540-70956-5\\_2", "10.1007/978-1-4471-2804-5\\_6", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.205", "10.1007/978-3-642-38527-8\\_6", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467592", "10.1094/pdis-08-11-0707", "10.1559/1523040054738936", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03085.x", "10.1007/978-1-84800-269-2\\_2", "10.1109/metrics.2005.24", "10.1016/s1053-8100(02)00007-7", "10.1007/978-0-85729-079-3", "10.1016/j.jebo.2011.08.009", "10.1559/152304009789786326", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467752", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01441.x", "10.1109/tits.2015.2436897", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.279", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.220", "10.1007/978-3-642-36763-2\\_41", "10.1145/2858036.2858558", "10.1179/000870403235002042"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13698", "year": "2019", "title": "Visual-Interactive Preprocessing of Multivariate Time Series Data", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "J{\\\"{u}}rgen Bernard;Marco Hutter;Heiko Reinemuth;Hendrik Pfeifer;Christian Bors;J{\\\"{o}}rn Kohlhammer", "citationCount": "2", "affiliation": "Bernard, J (Corresponding Author), Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.\nBernard, Juergen; Hutter, Marco; Reinemuth, Heiko; Pfeifer, Hendrik, Tech Univ Darmstadt, Darmstadt, Germany.\nBors, Christian, TU Wien, Vienna, Austria.\nKohlhammer, Joern, Fraunhofer IGD, Darmstadt, Germany.", "countries": "Germany;Austria", "abstract": "Pre-processing is a prerequisite to conduct effective and efficient downstream data analysis. Pre-processing pipelines often require multiple routines to address data quality challenges and to bring the data into a usable form. For both the construction and the refinement of pre-processing pipelines, human-in-the-loop approaches are highly beneficial. This particularly applies to multivariate time series, a complex data type with multiple values developing over time. Due to the high specificity of this domain, it has not been subject to in-depth research in visual analytics. We present a visual-interactive approach for preprocessing multivariate time series data with the following aspects. Our approach supports analysts to carry out six core analysis tasks related to pre-processing of multivariate time series. To support these tasks, we identify requirements to baseline toolkits that may help practitioners in their choice. We characterize the space of visualization designs for uncertainty-aware pre-processing and justify our decisions. Two usage scenarios demonstrate applicability of our approach, design choices, and uncertainty visualizations for the six analysis tasks.

These algorithms are typically \u201cblack boxes\u201d that work on mathematical models of the problem to solve. However, many problems are difficult to fully specify, and require a \u201chuman in the loop\u201d who collaborates with the algorithm by refining the model and guiding the search to produce acceptable solutions. Recently, the Problem-Solving Loop was introduced as a high-level model of such interactive optimisation. Here, we present and evaluate nine recommendations for the design of interactive visualisation tools supporting the Problem-Solving Loop. They range from the choice of visual representation for solutions and constraints to the use of a solution gallery to support exploration of alternate solutions. We first examined the applicability of the recommendations by investigating how well they had been supported in previous interactive optimisation tools. We then evaluated the recommendations in the context of the vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). To do so we built a sophisticated interactive visual system for solving VRPTW that was informed by the recommendations. Ten participants then used this system to solve a variety of routing problems. We report on participant comments and interaction patterns with the tool. These showed the tool was regarded as highly usable and the results generally supported the usefulness of the underlying recommendations.", "keywords": "Interactive optimisation,Interface design,Usability,Interactive systems and tools,Vehicle routing", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030364", "refList": ["10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18070881", "10.1006/obhd.1997.2679", "10.1109/vlhcc.2018.8506576", "10.1177/0956797611417632", "10.1177/0956797619830649", "10.1177/0049124115610347", "10.1177/1948550618775108", "10.1145/3313831.3376533", "10.1511/2014.111.460", "10.1145/2858036.2858465", "10.1145/3173574.3173606", "10.1177/1745691616658637", "10.1038/483531a", "10.1145/3173574.3174053", "10.1037/pspp0000186", "10.1016/j.jclinepi.2015.05.029", "10.1126/science.aac4716", "10.1145/985692.985782", "10.1080/02699931.2018.1524747", "10.1073/pnas.1402786111", "10.1145/3290605.3300295", "10.1111/cgf.13698", "10.1145/3290605.3300709", "10.2307/2686111", "10.1214/17-ba1091", "10.1145/1449715.1449732", "10.2139/ssrn.2694998", "10.1145/3313831.3376777", "10.1177/2515245917747646", "10.1145/3290605.3300754", "10.1145/3025453.3025626", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346321", "10.1037/gpr0000123", "10.2139/ssrn.2535453", "10.1145/3025453.3025738", "10.1038/533452a", "10.1177/1948550617714584", "10.1007/s11222-013-9416-2", "10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01832", "10.1038/s41562-018-0506-1", "10.1007/s11222-016-9696-4", "10.1177/1367006918763132", "10.1109/tsmc.1981.4308636", "10.1038/nrd3439-c1", "10.1177/0956797617723726", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03116.x", "10.1146/annurev-psych-122216-011836", "10.1145/3290605.3300432"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}], "len": 5}, "index": 1408, "embedding": [0.021645979955792427, 0.5682977437973022, 0.040369629859924316, 0.7444021105766296, -0.6896921992301941, 0.16650904715061188, -0.6933266520500183, 0.2259339690208435, -0.4727596938610077, -0.8766400814056396, -0.14821526408195496, -0.2115411013364792, -0.15391238033771515, 0.3862510323524475, -0.7121888399124146, 0.9634173512458801, 0.02965843491256237, 0.06749609857797623, -0.7390042543411255, 1.4865080118179321, -0.06630208343267441, 0.5866646766662598, -0.11392740160226822, 0.17951813340187073, -1.6394938230514526, 0.0859517902135849, -0.561912477016449, 0.07970847189426422, 0.9044961333274841, -1.4147255420684814, 0.05029619485139847, 0.35806533694267273], "projection": [0.3552733063697815, 6.823424339294434], "size": 3, "height": 3, "width": 1}
