Recent research has explored how to facilitate children's understanding of visual data representations through completion exercises which highlight links between concrete and abstract mappings. This approach scaffolds visualization activities by presenting a target visualization to children. But how can we engage children in more free-form visual data mapping exercises that are driven by their own mapping ideas? How can we scaffold a creative exploration of visualization techniques and mapping possibilities? We present Construct-A-Vis, a tablet-based tool designed to explore the feasibility of free-form and constructive visualization activities with elementary school children. Construct-A-Vis provides adjustable levels of scaffolding visual mapping processes. It can be used by children individually or as part of collaborative activities. Findings from a study with elementary school children using Construct-A-Vis individually and in pairs highlight the potential of this free-form constructive approach, as visible in children's diverse visualization outcomes and their critical engagement with the data and mapping processes. Based on our study findings we contribute insights into the design of free-form visualization tools for children, including the role of tool-based scaffolding mechanisms and shared interactions to guide visualization activities with children.", "keywords": "Visualization in Education,Visualization with Children,Qualitative Evaluation,Visualization System and Toolkit Design", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934804", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2011.287", "10.1145/2858036.2858435", "10.2312/pe.eurovisshort.eurovisshort2013.019-023", "10.1145/2998181.2998231", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346984", "10.1145/3025453.3025942", "10.1145/3173574.3174212", "10.1002/j.2168-9830.2004.tb00809.x", "10.1145/2669485.2669500", "10.1109/mcg.2018.032421650", "10.1111/j.1469-7610.1976.tb00381.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346292", "10.1145/2598784.2598806", "10.1145/2598510.2598566", "10.1145/234757.234765", "10.1016/j.compedu.2009.09.023", "10.1145/2485760.2485814", "10.1145/2207676.2208355", "10.1007/978-3-319-19773-9\\_130", "10.1145/2207676", "10.1016/j.sbspro.2011.12.091", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.164", "10.1145/1592761.1592779", "10.1145/3025453.3025537", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467831", "10.1007/s10648-014-9249-3", "10.1145/3025453.3025877"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030412", "title": "Sea of Genes: A Reflection on Visualising Metagenomic Data for Museums", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Keshav Dasu;Kwan-Liu Ma;Joyce Ma;Jennifer Frazier", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Dasu, K (Corresponding Author), Univ Calif Davis, Davis, CA 95616 USA.

Our exhibit sought to communicate new lessons based on scientific findings from the domain of metagenomics. This multi-user exhibit had three goals: (1) to inform the public about microbial communities and their daily cycles; (2) to link microbes' activity to the concept of gene expression; (3) and to highlight scientists' use of gene expression data to understand the role of microbes. To address these three goals, we derived visualization designs with three corresponding stories, each corresponding to a goal. We present three successive rounds of design and evaluation of our attempts to convey these goals. We could successfully present one story but had limited success with our second and third goals. This work presents a detailed account of an attempt to explain tightly coupled relationships through storytelling and animation in a multi-user, informal learning environment to a public with varying prior knowledge on the domain and identify lessons for future design.", "keywords": "Narrative visualization,storytelling,animation,evaluation,user studies,informal learning environments", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030412", "refList": ["10.1007/978-1-4471-6596-5", "10.1037/a0025595", "10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00283", "10.1145/2658537.2662985", "10.1177/1473871615594652", "10.28945/4441", "10.9743/jir.2013.6", "10.1145/2559206.2580098", "10.1007/s40593-015-0070-z", "10.1016/j.biopsycho.2015.01.008", "10.1145/3341215.3356283", "10.1348/000709906x143902", "10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01603.x", "10.2505/4/jcst15\\_", "10.1371/journal.pone.0082328", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346984", "10.4324/9781315735634", "10.1037/0022-3514.62.4.625", "10.1111/j.1467-8535.2012.01326.x", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532136", "10.1177/1555412005281767", "10.1080/08839510590910165", "10.1109/mcg.2018.032421650", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346292", "10.1145/960492.960494", "10.1007/978-1-4471-6596-55", "10.1145/2598784.2598806", "10.1108/10748120110424816", "10.1145/2598510.2598566", "10.1073/pnas.1807180116", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934804", "10.1016/j.compedu.2015.04.001", "10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.009695.x", "10.1080/00933104.2017.1400483", "10.1017/s1351324901002807", "10.1177/0963662514549688", "10.1111/cdev.12287", "10.1111/j.1468-2958.2004.tb00736.x", "10.1111/j.1365-2929.2004.01916.x", "10.1111/1467-8535.00121", "10.1145/3025453.3025877", "10.2190/119m-brmu-j8hc-xm6f"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 964, "embedding": [-0.008488024584949017, 0.5582875609397888, 1.2302366495132446, 1.0679322481155396, -0.6896921992301941, 0.16650904715061188, -0.6933266520500183, 0.556727409362793, -0.4727596938610077, -0.8766400814056396, 0.008092489093542099, -0.006229540333151817, -0.15391238033771515, 0.4315990209579468, 0.23700568079948425, 0.41921553015708923, 0.15252281725406647, 0.06749609857797623, -0.7390042543411255, 0.8943653702735901, -0.06630208343267441, 0.7628903985023499, -0.42358407378196716, -0.14990495145320892, 0.05319730564951897, 0.06111183390021324, -0.561912477016449, -0.2069312334060669, 0.9466985464096069, -0.02964480221271515, 0.297656387090683, 0.6024307608604431], "projection": [-3.6508657932281494, 5.941583156585693], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
