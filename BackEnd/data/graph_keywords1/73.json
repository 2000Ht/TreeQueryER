We first detect major communities in a network using data mining and community analysis methods. Then, the statistics attributes of each community, the relational strength between communities, and the boundary nodes connecting those communities are computed and stored. We propose a novel method based on Voronoi treemap to encode each community with a polygon and the relative positions of polygons encode their relational strengths. Different community attributes can be encoded by polygon shapes, sizes and colors. A corner-cutting method is further introduced to adjust the smoothness of polygons based on certain community attribute. To accommodate the boundary nodes, the gaps between the polygons are widened by a polygon-shrinking algorithm such that the boundary nodes can be conveniently embedded into the newly created spaces. The method is very efficient, enabling users to test different community detection algorithms, fine tune the results, and explore the fuzzy relations between communities interactively. The case studies with two real data sets demonstrate that our approach can provide a visual summary of major communities in a large network, and help people better understand the characteristics of each community and inspect various relational patterns between communities.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2015.7156355", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2013.76", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.172", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03080.x", "10.1007/s00779-011-0500-3", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2315995", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.232", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.210", "10.1109/2945.841119", "10.1145/1772690.1772755", "10.1137/0216006", "10.1016/0020-0190(89)90102-6", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.122", "10.1145/990308.990313", "10.1111/cgf.12104", "10.1002/spe.4380211102", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.34", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.250", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183571", "10.1016/j.physrep.2009.11.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.107", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.160", "10.1016/0146-664x(74)90028-8", "10.1109/infvis.2004.43", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.186", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500092", "10.1145/2487788.2488173", "10.1007/bf02289565"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030440", "title": "Context-aware Sampling of Large Networks via Graph Representation Learning", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Zhiguang Zhou;Chen Shi;Xilong Shen;Lihong Cai;Haoxuan Wang;Yuhua Liu;Ying Zhao;Wei Chen", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Zhao, Y (Corresponding Author), Cent South Univ, Changsha, Peoples R China.

It is of great challenge to preserve contextual structures formed by nodes and edges with tight relationships in a sampled graph, because they are easily overlooked during the process of sampling due to their irregular distribution and immunity to scale. In this paper, a new graph sampling method is proposed oriented to the preservation of contextual structures. We first utilize a graph representation learning (GRL) model to transform nodes into vectors so that the contextual structures in a network can be effectively extracted and organized. Then, we propose a multi-objective blue noise sampling model to select a subset of nodes in the vectorized space to preserve contextual structures with the retention of relative data and cluster densities in addition to those features of significance, such as bridging nodes and graph connections. We also design a set of visual interfaces enabling users to interactively conduct context-aware sampling, visually compare results with various sampling strategies, and deeply explore large networks. Case studies and quantitative comparisons based on real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in the abstraction and exploration of large networks.", "keywords": "Graph sampling,Graph representation learning,Blue noise sampling,Graph evaluation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030440", "refList": ["10.1145/2491159.2491168", "10.1016/j.physa.2015.04.035", "10.1145/1830252.1830274", "10.1109/icdmw.2007.91", "10.1002/net.21834", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864503", "10.1016/j.cag.2018.01.010", "10.1109/icc.2016.7511156", "10.1111/cgf.13444", "10.1145/956750.956831", "10.1145/364099.364331", "10.1007/s00180-016-0663-5", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.223", "10.1007/s12650-018-0530-2", "10.1103/physreve.73.016102", "10.1109/access.2018.2870684", "10.1007/978-3-319-06793-3\\_1", "10.2312/vissym/eurovis05/239-246", "10.1016/j.ins.2015.02.014", "10.1145/2339530.2339723", "10.1109/icde.2015.7113345", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.233", "10.14778/2809974.2809980", "10.1109/glocom.2015.7417471", "10.1145/2578153.2578175", "10.1214/aoms/1177705148", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.130", "10.14232/actacyb.20.1.2011.6", "10.1504/ijitm.2019.099809", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865020", "10.1145/956750", "10.1002/cpe.4330060203", "10.1145/1150402.1150479", "10.1103/physreve.72.036118", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744098", "10.1145/2020408.2020512", "10.1142/s0129183114400075", "10.1109/jsac.2011.111005", "10.1016/j.camwa.2011.11.057", "10.1145/2470654.2466444", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2674999", "10.1214/aos/1013203451", "10.1109/icdcsw.2011.34", "10.1016/j.physa.2013.11.015", "10.1145/1081870.1081893", "10.1109/tnet.2008.2001730", "10.1109/access.2016.2633485", "10.1145/1879141.1879192", "10.1371/journal.pone.0098679", "10.1126/science.220.4598.671", "10.1109/pacificvis.2015.7156355", "10.1088/1475-7516/2011/08/011", "10.1007/978-3-319-27261-0\\_41", "10.1111/cgf.13410", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865139", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831", "10.1016/j.physa.2014.06.065"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 73, "embedding": [0.35515308380126953, 0.3467486798763275, 1.5809695720672607, 0.7817277312278748, -0.6870212554931641, 0.16650904715061188, -0.6826844215393066, 0.7245915532112122, -0.40999409556388855, -0.8447319865226746, 0.14420151710510254, -0.14403526484966278, -0.12592144310474396, 0.004059445112943649, 0.20138312876224518, 0.38379132747650146, 0.2515806257724762, 0.06402745097875595, -0.6852008700370789, 0.9779887199401855, -0.06630208343267441, 0.6068780422210693, -0.6511510014533997, -0.13563132286071777, -0.4936079978942871, 0.09350619465112686, -0.5670700073242188, -0.1346617043018341, 0.5323851704597473, 0.7683486342430115, 0.2747313678264618, 0.5230805277824402], "projection": [-3.679020643234253, 5.666525363922119], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
