From this data, many people might confidently state that a before-school breakfast program would lead to higher grades. This is a reasoning error, because correlation does not necessarily indicate causation \u2013 X and Y can be correlated without one directly causing the other. While this error is pervasive, its prevalence might be amplified or mitigated by the way that the data is presented to a viewer. Across three crowdsourced experiments, we examined whether how simple data relations are presented would mitigate this reasoning error. The first experiment tested examples similar to the breakfast-GPA relation, varying in the plausibility of the causal link. We asked participants to rate their level of agreement that the relation was correlated, which they rated appropriately as high. However, participants also expressed high agreement with a causal interpretation of the data. Levels of support for the causal interpretation were not equally strong across visualization types: causality ratings were highest for text descriptions and bar graphs, but weaker for scatter plots. But is this effect driven by bar graphs aggregating data into two groups or by the visual encoding type? We isolated data aggregation versus visual encoding type and examined their individual effect on perceived causality. Overall, different visualization designs afford different cognitive reasoning affordances across the same data. High levels of data aggregation by graphs tend to be associated with higher perceived causality in data. Participants perceived line and dot visual encodings as more causal than bar encodings. Our results demonstrate how some visualization designs trigger stronger causal links while choosing others can help mitigate unwarranted perceptions of causality.", "keywords": "Information Visualization,Correlation and Causation,Visualization Design,Reasoning Affordance", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934399", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346979", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864909", "10.2307/2277140", "10.2307/2276829", "10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00888", "10.3758/s13423-012-0247-5", "10.1177/1075547012458290", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346419", "10.1207/s15516709cog0000\\_70", "10.1037/0003-066x.53.4.449", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2743898", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585665", "10.1159/000323281", "10.1016/j.crm.2015.06.007", "10.1002/9781119055259", "10.1002/acp.2350050106", "10.1136/bmj.g7015", "10.3758/bf03201236", "10.1073/pnas.1608845113", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.173", "10.1109/beliv.2018.8634267", "10.1145/3025453.3025512", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598594", "10.2307/2288400", "10.1080/00461520.2014.921572", "10.1002/jhbs.20078", "10.1016/s0010-0277(00)00060-3", "10.1016/0885-2014(88)90027-5", "10.1016/bs.plm.2016.11.006", "10.1016/j.cognition.2012.04.005", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346298", "10.1257/aer.100.2.573", "10.1145/2858036.2858558"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3028958", "title": "Auditing the Sensitivity of Graph-based Ranking with Visual Analytics", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Tiankai Xie;Yuxin Ma;Hanghang Tong;My T.

For example, what items shall we recommend to a given user on an e-commerce platform? The answers to such questions are typically returned in the form of a ranked list, and graph-based ranking methods are widely used in industrial information retrieval settings. However, these ranking algorithms have a variety of sensitivities, and even small changes in rank can lead to vast reductions in product sales and page hits. As such, there is a need for tools and methods that can help model developers and analysts explore the sensitivities of graph ranking algorithms with respect to perturbations within the graph structure. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for explaining and exploring the sensitivity of any graph-based ranking algorithm by performing perturbation-based what-if analysis. We demonstrate our framework through three case studies inspecting the sensitivity of two classic graph-based ranking algorithms (PageRank and HITS) as applied to rankings in political news media and social networks.", "keywords": "Graph-based ranking,sensitivity analysis,visual analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028958", "refList": ["10.1109/wsc.2017.8247800", "10.1023/a:1022649401552", "10.1515/1559-0410.11416", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598919", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934630", "10.1140/epjds29", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934670", "10.1016/j.eswa.2015.09.004", "10.1145/2702123.2702509", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.12.001", "10.2307/3002000", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934399", "10.1007/s41060-016-0032-z", "10.1111/cgf.13198", "10.14778/2350229.2350254", "10.1145/2939672.2939764", "10.1016/j.visinf.2017.01.006", "10.1145/2858036.2858529", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585647", "10.1007/bf01187020", "10.1109/icdm.2015.26", "10.1145/2362383.2362387", "10.1177/0049124104268644", "10.1109/vast.2011.6102442", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249025", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864475", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70528", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467691", "10.1111/cgf.13210", "10.1214/aos/1176344136", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2424872", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.09.001", "10.1177/089443939100900106", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467931", "10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735", "10.1007/s11162-011-9241-4", "10.1111/cgf.13680", "10.1145/3065386", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864889", "10.1177/003804070808100402", "10.1109/icdm.2010.62", "10.1038/s41598-020-59669-x", "10.1162/153244303321897717", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934619", "10.1007/bf00356088", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598432", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030465", "title": "Visual Causality Analysis of Event Sequence Data", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Zhuochen Jin;Shunan Guo;Nan Chen;Daniel Weiskopf;David Gotz;Nan Cao", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Cao, N (Corresponding Author), Tongji Univ, IDVx Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

Event sequence data is widely collected from many real-world processes, such as electronic health records, web clickstreams, and financial transactions, which transmit a great deal of information reflecting the causal relations among event types. Unfortunately, recovering causalities from observational event sequences is challenging, as the heterogeneous and high-dimensional event variables are often connected to rather complex underlying event excitation mechanisms that are hard to infer from limited observations. Many existing automated causal analysis techniques suffer from poor explainability and fail to include an adequate amount of human knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics method for recovering causalities in event sequence data. We extend the Granger causality analysis algorithm on Hawkes processes to incorporate user feedback into causal model refinement. The visualization system includes an interactive causal analysis framework that supports bottom-up causal exploration, iterative causal verification and refinement, and causal comparison through a set of novel visualizations and interactions. We report two forms of evaluation: a quantitative evaluation of the model improvements resulting from the user-feedback mechanism, and a qualitative evaluation through case studies in different application domains to demonstrate the usefulness of the system.", "keywords": "Event sequence data,causality analysis,visual analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030465", "refList": ["10.5555/1642718", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865022", "10.5555/2074094.2074151", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2618797", "10.1073/pnas.1320645111", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744843", "10.1109/iv.2017.69", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934399", "10.1145/3172944.3173007", "10.5555/1795555", "10.1109/mcg.2005.102", "10.1145/381641.381653", "10.1162/153244301753344614", "10.1111/cgf.14034", "10.1111/cgf.13198", "10.1017/cbo9780511519857", "10.1007/s10462-016-9475-9", "10.1075/ssol.2.2.07bor", "10.1007/978-1-4614-3223-4\\_3", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249025", "10.1007/978-94-007-6094-313", "10.1145/2858036.2858387", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70528", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2674958", "10.1147/sj.454.0801", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.119", "10.1145/3173574.3173711", "10.1016/j.erss.2017.06.034", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933695", "10.1007/s11665-016-2173-6", "10.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-7", "10.2307/3601125", "10.1016/b978-0-444-88738-2.50018-x", "10.1109/mcg.2006.70", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865145", "10.1017/s1351324997001502", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.179", "10.1214/aos/1176344552", "10.1109/mcg.2009.22", "10.1007/978-3-319-26633-6\\_13", "10.1080/10447318.2014.905422", "10.1016/j.visinf.2019.03.004", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500074", "10.1007/978-1-4614-3223-4"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 5}, "index": 900, "embedding": [1.871527075767517, -0.30501702427864075, 2.472221612930298, 0.9649693965911865, -0.6897369623184204, 0.16650904715061188, -0.664513111114502, -0.8430131673812866, -0.09691061824560165, -0.9566591382026672, 1.1265010833740234, -0.18213537335395813, -0.1686236411333084, 0.017230423167347908, 2.330981969833374, -0.5263585448265076, 0.6780358552932739, 0.06877747178077698, 0.862360954284668, -0.007176631595939398, -0.06630208343267441, -0.5716211795806885, 0.5120000839233398, -0.1691095381975174, 0.15278643369674683, 0.04334019869565964, -0.5834015607833862, 0.1649826318025589, -0.5749752521514893, 3.6168949604034424, 1.3374309539794922, 0.4334522485733032], "projection": [-3.086425542831421, 4.899466037750244], "size": 3, "height": 2, "width": 2}
