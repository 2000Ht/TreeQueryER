To enable the integration of visual analytics in such experiments, we introduce VEEVVIE, the Visual Explorer for Empirical Visualization, VR and Interaction Experiments. VEEVVIE is comprised of a back-end ontology which can model several experimental designs encountered in these fields. This formalization allows VEEVVIE to capture experimental data in a query-able form and makes it accessible through a front-end interface. This front-end offers several multi-dimensional visualization widgets with built-in filtering and highlighting functionality. VEEVVIE is also expandable to support custom experimental measurements and data types through a plug-in visualization widget architecture. We demonstrate VEEVVIE through several case studies of visual analysis, performed on the design and data collected during an experiment on the scalability of high-resolution, immersive, tiled-display walls.", "keywords": "Visual Analytics, Evaluation, User Studies, Ontology, Experiments, Interaction, Virtual Reality, Visualization", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467954", "refList": ["10.1109/mcg.2014.80", "10.1207/s15327108ijap0303\\_3", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346591", "10.2307/1269768", "10.1109/mcg.2014.97", "10.1109/tvcg.2004.1260759", "10.1109/cmv.2007.20", "10.1109/2945.981851", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346311", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.251", "10.3138/fm57-6770-u75u-7727", "10.1109/infvis.2004.12", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.157", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.276", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.40", "10.1109/vrais.1997.583043", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.20"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030448", "title": "Retrieve-Then-Adapt: Example-based Automatic Generation for Proportion-related Infographics", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Chunyao Qian;Shizhao Sun;Weiwei Cui;Jian-Guang Lou;Haidong Zhang;Dongmei Zhang", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Qian, CY (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Beijing, Peoples R China.

Creating infographics is a difficult and time-consuming process which often requires significant attempts and adjustments even for experienced designers, not to mention novice users with limited design expertise. Recently, a few approaches have been proposed to automate the creation process by applying predefined blueprints to user information. However, predefined blueprints are often hard to create, hence limited in volume and diversity. In contrast, good infogrpahics have been created by professionals and accumulated on the Internet rapidly. These online examples often represent a wide variety of design styles, and serve as exemplars or inspiration to people who like to create their own infographics. Based on these observations, we propose to generate infographics by automatically imitating examples. We present a two-stage approach, namely retrieve-then-adapt. In the retrieval stage, we index online examples by their visual elements. For a given user information, we transform it to a concrete query by sampling from a learned distribution about visual elements, and then find appropriate examples in our example library based on the similarity between example indexes and the query. For a retrieved example, we generate an initial drafts by replacing its content with user information. However, in many cases, user information cannot be perfectly fitted to retrieved examples. Therefore, we further introduce an adaption stage. Specifically, we propose a MCMC-like approach and leverage recursive neural networks to help adjust the initial draft and improve its visual appearance iteratively, until a satisfactory result is obtained. We implement our approach on widely-used proportion-related infographics, and demonstrate its effectiveness by sample results and expert reviews.", "keywords": "Infographics,automatic visualization", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030448", "refList": ["10.1001/archpediatrics.2011.97", "10.1016/j.infsof.2007.02.015", "10.1177/1745691614528520", "10.1177/0165025413515169", "10.1145/2702123.2702347", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598918", "10.1145/3290605.3300447", "10.1016/s0020-7373(86)80019-0", "10.1038/nrn3475", "10.1007/978-3-319-26633-6\\_6", "10.1098/rsif.2006.0134", "10.1037/0033-295x.101.1.80", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2743898", "10.1198/000313001317098149", "10.1007/978-3-319-67687-6\\_10", "10.1145/3290605.3300295", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.124", "10.1016/b978-0-12-805390-4.00003-0", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01938.x", "10.18637/jss.v067.i01", "10.1145/3173574.3174216", "10.1037/0033-2909.86.3.638", "10.1002/ejsp.2023", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467954", "10.1109/tvcg.2005.53", "10.3758/s13428-013-0424-0", "10.1145/3173574.3173715", "10.1016/b978-0-12-179060-8.50012-8", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933695", "10.3758/bf03203630", "10.1002/bimj.200810425", "10.1207/s15328007sem0904\\_8", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183556", "10.1016/j.apergo.2004.01.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346298", "10.1109/beliv.2018.8634392", "10.1145/2858036.2858498", "10.3758/bf03193146", "10.2307/2685373", "10.1016/b978-0-12-179060-8.50007-4", "10.1145/1735223.1735255"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 510, "embedding": [0.15956377983093262, 0.7474998831748962, 0.6370130181312561, 1.4087616205215454, -0.6604432463645935, 0.16650904715061188, -0.2247553914785385, 1.7469724416732788, -0.43251052498817444, -0.7608237266540527, 0.15147477388381958, 0.728119432926178, -0.13702842593193054, 1.7253834009170532, 0.6904704570770264, 0.7172564268112183, -0.12305981665849686, 0.0788058489561081, -0.6558851003646851, -0.7877016663551331, -0.06630208343267441, 1.691426396369934, 0.08724084496498108, -0.114951491355896, 0.6813302636146545, 0.10712844133377075, -0.5328229665756226, 0.1936085820198059, 1.6791132688522339, -0.8147825002670288, 0.2879340648651123, 0.7880592346191406], "projection": [-4.556628704071045, 7.38993501663208], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
