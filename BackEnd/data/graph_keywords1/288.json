In this research, we have visualized the correlation between Pressure and Temperature in the climate datasets. Pearson correlation is used in this study to measure the major linear relationship between two variables in the dataset. Using glyphs in the spatial location, we highlighted the significant association between variables. Based on the positive or negative slope of correlation lines, we can conclude how much they are correlated. The principal of this research is visualizing the local trend of variables versus each other in multidimensional multivariate time-varying datasets, which needs to be visualized with their spatial locations in meteorological datasets. Using glyphs, not only can we visualize the correlation between two variables in the coordinate system, but we can also discern whether any of these variables is separately increasing or decreasing. Moreover, we can visualize the background color as another variable and see the correlation lines around of a particular zone such as storm area.", "keywords": "", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429502", "refList": ["10.1109/vast.2010.5652460", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742369"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 288, "embedding": [-2.1418709754943848, -0.2901577949523926, -1.0366979837417603, -0.36266013979911804, -0.2160092294216156, 0.16650904715061188, 4.429186820983887, 1.5800764560699463, 6.711771011352539, -0.6967183947563171, 2.528451442718506, -1.0838862657546997, 0.005573777016252279, 1.9889839887619019, -0.9044764637947083, -0.5381391644477844, -0.20442822575569153, 0.06749609857797623, -0.3395666182041168, 0.01539750024676323, -0.06630208343267441, 0.5692785978317261, -0.19383466243743896, -0.14990495145320892, -1.151760458946228, 2.681239366531372, -0.561912477016449, -0.2069312334060669, -0.5637652277946472, -2.7424004077911377, 0.15335805714130402, -0.9553877711296082], "projection": [-9.737444877624512, -14.842957496643066], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
