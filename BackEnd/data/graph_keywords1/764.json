The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.", "keywords": "Vortex extraction,inertial particles,objectivity,vortex coreline", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828", "refList": ["10.1016/0377-0257(79)87004-4", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1016/0167-2789(91)90088-q", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70633", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_9", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1017/s002211209900467x", "10.1143/jpsj.66.1331", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1017/s0022112092001460", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01238.x", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/visual.1997.663910", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1146/annurev.fluid.23.1.601", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "10.1145/1057432.1057452", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1007/s100219900068", "10.2514/2.744", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1016/0960-0779(94)90137-6", "10.1016/0010-4655(88)90020-3", "10.1109/visual.1991.175773", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1016/j.ijengsci.2007.10.005", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.11", "10.1111/cgf.13439", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1145/2897824.2925919", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0011-7471(70)90059-8", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1053"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13689", "year": "2019", "title": "Robust Reference Frame Extraction from Unsteady 2D Vector Fields with Convolutional Neural Networks", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Byungsoo Kim;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Kim, B (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nKim, Byungsoo; Guenther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Robust feature extraction is an integral part of scientific visualization. In unsteady vector field analysis, researchers recently directed their attention towards the computation of near-steady reference frames for vortex extraction, which is a numerically challenging endeavor. In this paper, we utilize a convolutional neural network to combine two steps of the visualization pipeline in an end-to-end manner: the filtering and the feature extraction. We use neural networks for the extraction of a steady reference frame for a given unsteady 2D vector field. By conditioning the neural network to noisy inputs and resampling artifacts, we obtain numerically stabler results than existing optimization-based approaches. Supervised deep learning typically requires a large amount of training data. Thus, our second contribution is the creation of a vector field benchmark data set, which is generally useful for any local deep learning-based feature extraction. Based on Vatistas velocity profile, we formulate a parametric vector field mixture model that we parameterize based on numerically-computed example vector fields in near-steady reference frames.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets.
