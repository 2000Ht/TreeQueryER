Cryptocurrency exchanges, which act as the gateway to this world, now play a dominant role in the circulation of Bitcoin. Thus, delving into the analysis of the transaction patterns of exchanges can shed light on the evolution and trends in the Bitcoin market, and participants can gain hints for identifying credible exchanges as well. Not only Bitcoin practitioners but also researchers in the financial domains are interested in the business intelligence behind the curtain. However, the task of multiple exchanges exploration and comparisons has been limited owing to the lack of efficient tools. Previous methods of visualizing Bitcoin data have mainly concentrated on tracking suspicious transaction logs, but it is cumbersome to analyze exchanges and their relationships with existing tools and methods. In this paper, we present BitExTract, an interactive visual analytics system, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to explore the evolutionary transaction patterns of Bitcoin exchanges from two perspectives, namely, exchange versus exchange and exchange versus client. In particular, BitExTract summarizes the evolution of the Bitcoin market by observing the transactions between exchanges over time via a massive sequence view. A node-link diagram with ego-centered views depicts the trading network of exchanges and their temporal transaction distribution. Moreover, BitExTract embeds multiple parallel bars on a timeline to examine and compare the evolution patterns of transactions between different exchanges. Three case studies with novel insights demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our system.", "keywords": "Bitcoin exchange,transaction data,comparative analysis,visual analytics,FinTech", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864814", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2008.117", "10.1109/mcg.2004.28", "10.1111/cgf.12791", "10.1371/journal.pone.0161197", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.180", "10.1089/big.2015.0056", "10.1007/978-3-319-70278-0\\_16", "10.1111/cgf.12931", "10.1371/journal.pone.0163477", "10.1109/vizsec.2015.7312773", "10.1109/passat/socialcom.2011.79", "10.1080/10447318.2010.516722", "10.1109/comst.2016.2535718", "10.1007/978-3-319-06793-3\\_8", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.169", "10.1007/978-3-319-70278-0\\_9", "10.1109/sp.2015.14", "10.1109/vast.2007.4389009", "10.1093/rfs/hhs091", "10.1145/2504730.2504747", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346913", "10.1177/1473871613487087"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934660", "title": "sPortfolio: Stratified Visual Analysis of Stock Portfolios", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Xuanwu Yue;Jiaxin Bai;Qinhan Liu;Yiyang Tang;Abishek Puri;Ke Li;Huamin Qu", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Yue, XW (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Univ Sci \\& Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

The essence of quantitative investment is the multi-factor model, which explains the relationship between the risk and return of equities. However, the multi-factor model generates enormous quantities of factor data, through which even experienced portfolio managers find it difficult to navigate. This has led to portfolio analysis and factor research being limited by a lack of intuitive visual analytics tools. Previous portfolio visualization systems have mainly focused on the relationship between the portfolio return and stock holdings, which is insufficient for making actionable insights or understanding market trends. In this paper, we present s Portfolio, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first visualization that attempts to explore the factor investment area. In particular, sPortfolio provides a holistic overview of the factor data and aims to facilitate the analysis at three different levels: a Risk-Factor level, for a general market situation analysis; a Multiple-Portfolio level, for understanding the portfolio strategies; and a Single-Portfolio level, for investigating detailed operations. The system's effectiveness and usability are demonstrated through three case studies. The system has passed its pilot study and is soon to be deployed in industry.", "keywords": "Stock portfolio,visual analytics,factor investment,financial data analysis", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934660", "refList": ["10.1145/3038912.3052569", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.117", "10.1109/iv.2013.31", "10.1111/cgf.12931", "10.1002/asi.20317", "10.1145/312624.312682", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500081", "10.1109/iv.2009.29", "10.1109/iv.2008.80", "10.2312/vissym/eurovis06/195-202", "10.1109/vast.2009.5333920", "10.1016/j.artmed.2005.03.001", "10.1109/iv.2002.1028770", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249027", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500061", "10.2307/2329112", "10.1016/b978-155860915-0/50046-9", "10.1007/bf03182429", "10.1016/j.cag.2007.01.030", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864814", "10.1109/vast.2010.5652530", "10.1126/science.1127647", "10.1007/978-0-85729-079-3"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 757, "embedding": [0.70958411693573, -0.19245116412639618, 1.834363341331482, 0.5843788385391235, -0.6539726853370667, 0.16650904715061188, -0.7323254346847534, 0.22423438727855682, -0.4441397190093994, -0.8419216275215149, 0.16330361366271973, -0.5620778203010559, -0.14601923525333405, -0.4041314721107483, 1.049265742301941, -0.21228067576885223, 0.4692331552505493, 0.07072390615940094, -0.339347243309021, 0.698811411857605, -0.06630208343267441, 0.15463705360889435, -0.3332332372665405, -0.1390654742717743, -0.3606345057487488, 0.08711085468530655, -0.5452967882156372, -0.19688554108142853, -0.5408883690834045, 2.327791690826416, 0.3910430669784546, 0.3197210431098938], "projection": [-3.4367713928222656, 5.1604695320129395], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
