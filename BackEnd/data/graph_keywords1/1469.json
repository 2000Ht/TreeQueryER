A CFG is a directed graph representing possible execution paths in a program. CFGs are commonly visualized as node-link diagrams while traces are commonly viewed in raw text format. Visualizing and exploring CFGs and traces is challenging because of the complexity and specificity of the operations researchers perform. We present a design study where we collaborate with computer scientists researching dynamic binary analysis and compilation techniques. The research group primarily employs CFGs and traces to reason about and develop new algorithms for program optimization and parallelization. Through questionnaires, interviews, and a year-long observation, we analyzed their use of visualization, noting that the tasks they perform match common subroutines they employ in their techniques. Based on this task analysis, we designed CFGExplorer, a visual analytics system that supports computer scientists with interactions that are integrated with the program structure. We developed a domain-specific graph modification to generate graph layouts that reflect program structure. CFGExplorer incorporates structures such as functions and loops, and uses the correspondence between CFGs and traces to support navigation. We further augment the system to highlight the output of program analysis techniques, facilitating exploration at a higher level. We evaluate the tool through guided sessions and semi-structured interviews as well as deployment. Our collaborators have integrated CFGExplorer into their workflow and use it to reason about programs, develop and debug new algorithms, and share their findings.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13433", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2006.120", "10.1016/j.ijhcs.2012.09.004", "10.1145/24039.24041", "10.1109/32.221135", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1109/icsm.2004.1357801", "10.1111/cgf.12394", "10.1002/1097-024x(200009)30:11", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500116", "10.1109/sc.2014.70", "10.1016/j.cag.2009.06.002", "10.1111/cgf.12883", "10.1109/vissoft.2014.25", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.34", "10.1145/1168149.1168168", "10.1109/infvis.2004.1", "10.1145/291224.291229", "10.1109/tsmc.1981.4308636", "10.1002/smr.291", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744319"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934285", "title": "Visualizing a Moving Target: A Design Study on Task Parallel Programs in the Presence of Evolving Data and Concerns", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Katy Williams;Alex Bigelow;Katherine E.

While it is often prudent to avoid such projects, we argue it can be beneficial to engage them in some cases as the visualization process can help refine data collection, solving a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d problem of having the data and tools to analyze it. We found this to be the case in the domain of task parallel computing where such data and tooling is an open area of research. Despite these hurdles, we conducted a design study. Through a tightly-coupled iterative design process, we built Atria, a multi-view execution graph visualization to support performance analysis. Atria simplifies the initial representation of the execution graph by aggregating nodes as related to their line of code. We deployed Atria on multiple platforms, some requiring design alteration. We describe how we adapted the design study methodology to the \u201cmoving target\u201d of both the data and the domain experts' concerns and how this movement kept both the visualization and programming project healthy. We reflect on our process and discuss what factors allow the project to be successful in the presence of changing data and user needs.", "keywords": "design studies,software visualization,parallel computing,graph visualization", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934285", "refList": ["10.1007/978-3-642-31476-6\\_7", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2859974", "10.1145/3337821.3337915", "10.1109/tse.1981.234519", "10.1109/32.221135", "10.1111/cgf.13433", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865076", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865149", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346323", "10.3233/978-1-61499-649-1-87", "10.1145/2993901.2993911", "10.1109/mcg.2011.103", "10.1002/1097-024x(200009)30:11", "10.1177/1094342006064482", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500116", "10.1177/1473871615621602", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.124", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249009", "10.1145/642611.642616", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467452", "10.1109/cw.2002.1180907", "10.1145/3125571.3125585", "10.1145/2807591.2807634", "10.1109/infvis.2002.1173148", "10.1145/2676870.2676883", "10.1145/1168149.1168168", "10.1007/978-3-030-17872-7\\_14", "10.1145/2993901.2993916", "10.1109/iotdi.2015.41", "10.1109/infvis.2004.1", "10.1080/14639220903165169", "10.1109/hpdc.2000.868632", "10.1145/882262.882291", "10.1109/mcse.2013.98", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2811488", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744319", "10.1007/978-3-642-31476-67", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2874523", "10.1109/sc.2012.71"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030355", "title": "Guidelines For Pursuing and Revealing Data Abstractions", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Alex Bigelow;Katy Williams;Katherine E.
