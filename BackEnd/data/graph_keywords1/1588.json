For example, we can derive a student's learning curve (an indicator of cognitive skill) from the changes in the difficulty level of problems solved, or derive a student's self-regulation patterns (an example of non-cognitive traits and behaviors) based on the problem-solving frequency over time. Few studies provide an integrated overview of both aspects by unfolding the problem-solving process. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system named SeqDynamics that evaluates students' problem-solving dynamics from both cognitive and non-cognitive perspectives. The system visualizes the chronological sequence of learners' problem-solving behavior through a set of novel visual designs and coordinated contextual views, enabling users to compare and evaluate problem-solving dynamics on multiple scales. We present three scenarios to demonstrate the usefulness of SeqDynamics on a real-world dataset which consists of thousands of problem-solving traces. We also conduct five expert interviews to show that SeqDynamics enhances domain experts' understanding of learning behavior sequences and assists them in completing evaluation tasks efficiently.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13998", "refList": ["10.1109/pacificvis.2014.13", "10.1145/2702123.2702419", "10.1109/vast.2016.7883512", "10.1146/annurev.soc.29.010202.100023", "10.1016/j.landurbplan.2016.06.009", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.167", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2872961", "10.1109/vast.2016.7883517", "10.1145/3303772.3303782", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.173", "10.1109/2945.981848", "10.1145/3308558.3313569", "10.1145/3303772.3303801", "10.1145/506443.506505", "10.2312/pe/eurovisshort/eurovisshort2012/097-101", "10.1016/j.chb.2014.09.022", "10.1111/j.1745-3984.2003.tb01108.x", "10.1145/3303772.3303780", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.179", "10.1080/0950069042000230767", "10.1109/asianhost.2017.8353997", "10.1007/978-0-85729-079-3"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1588, "embedding": [-1.9514179229736328, -0.26493993401527405, -1.059349536895752, -0.3480980396270752, -0.3121996223926544, 0.16650904715061188, 4.804631233215332, 1.22976815700531, 5.3700761795043945, -0.6374728679656982, 1.9450945854187012, -1.0641764402389526, 0.06583120673894882, 1.8442310094833374, -0.7106465697288513, -0.5486658811569214, -0.17872647941112518, 0.07991757988929749, -0.2869078516960144, 0.48070228099823, -0.06630208343267441, 0.5107607245445251, -0.10843748599290848, -0.13207590579986572, -1.3927513360977173, 2.2763984203338623, -0.5399249196052551, -0.17674389481544495, -0.5434138178825378, -2.582859516143799, 0.136640727519989, -0.9124329686164856], "projection": [-8.28410530090332, 22.6519832611084], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
