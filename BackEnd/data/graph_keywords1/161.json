Although understanding these regions could provide huge insights to facilitate valuable applications for urban planning and business intelligence, few methods have been developed to effectively capture the rapid transformation of urban regions. In recent years, the widely applied location-acquisition technologies offer a more effective way to capture the dynamics of a city through analyzing people's movement activities based on mobility data. However, several challenges exist, including data sparsity and difficulties in result understanding and validation. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose MobiSeg, an interactive visual analytics system, which supports the exploration of people's movement activities to segment the urban area into regions sharing similar activity patterns. A joint analysis is conducted on three types of heterogeneous mobility data (i.e., taxi trajectories, metro passenger RFID card data, and telco data), which can complement each other and provide a full picture of people's activities in a region. In addition, advanced analytical algorithms (e.g., non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) based method to capture latent activity patterns, as well as metric learning to calibrate and supervise the underlying analysis) and novel visualization designs are integrated into our system to provide a comprehensive solution to region segmentation in urban areas. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system via case studies with real-world datasets and qualitative interviews with domain experts.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2017.8031583", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2013.226", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.44", "10.1561/2200000019", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2468111", "10.1109/tits.2012.2209201", "10.2307/621647", "10.1109/tkde.2014.2345405", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467194", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742386", "10.1080/01431160512331316838", "10.1007/s10980-005-5238-8", "10.1145/2629592", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467619", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467592", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.228", "10.1111/cgf.12654", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346271", "10.1109/percomw.2011.5766912", "10.1111/cgf.12114", "10.1007/978-3-662-44848-9\\_32", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532144", "10.1109/vast.2015.7347630", "10.1017/s0026749x10000314", "10.1137/s0036144599352836", "10.1145/860435.860485", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.168", "10.1109/tbdata.2016.2586447", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042490", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.265", "10.1109/vast.2011.6102455", "10.1162/jmlr.2003.3.4-5.993", "10.1016/j.landurbplan.2009.05.001", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2440259", "10.1111/cgf.12107"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030370", "title": "TaxThemis: Interactive Mining and Exploration of Suspicious Tax Evasion Groups", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Yating Lin;Kamkwai Wong;Yong Wang;Rong Zhang;Bo Dong;Huamin Qu;Qinghua Zheng", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Lin, YT (Corresponding Author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, MOEKLINNS Lab, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

Recent research has applied data analytics techniques to analyze and detect tax evasion behaviors of individual taxpayers. However, they have failed to support the analysis and exploration of the related party transaction tax evasion (RPTTE) behaviors (e.g., transfer pricing), where a group of taxpayers is involved. In this paper, we present TaxThemis, an interactive visual analytics system to help tax officers mine and explore suspicious tax evasion groups through analyzing heterogeneous tax-related data. A taxpayer network is constructed and fused with the respective trade network to detect suspicious RPTTE groups. Rich visualizations are designed to facilitate the exploration and investigation of suspicious transactions between related taxpayers with profit and topological data analysis. Specifically, we propose a calendar heatmap with a carefully-designed encoding scheme to intuitively show the evidence of transferring revenue through related party transactions. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of TaxThemis through two case studies on real-world tax-related data and interviews with domain experts.", "keywords": "Visual Analytics,Tax Network,Tax Evasion Detection,Anomaly detection,Multidimensional data", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030370", "refList": ["10.1111/cgf.12886", "10.2307/2277827", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.44", "10.1109/tits.2014.2315794", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934670", "10.1038/s41467-019-08987-4", "10.1111/cgf.12920", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585721", "10.1080/15230406.2015.1093431", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2843369", "10.1038/srep01001", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744018", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744159", "10.1068/b130199p", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.143", "10.1016/j.visinf.2017.01.006", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2892483", "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031583", "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.2785", "10.2307/2686111", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467199", "10.1111/cgf.12114", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865126", "10.1111/j.1538-4632.1996.tb00936.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934619", "10.2307/2332142", "10.1007/978-3-319-10590-1\\_53", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.485", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.17", "10.2307/2986645", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346321", "10.1017/s0140525x16001837", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598541", "10.1371/journal.pone.0207377", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346265", "10.1007/s4095-020-0191-7", "10.3141/1644-14", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744158", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865027", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2785807", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744358", "10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00338.x", "10.1080/03081068808717359", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00027", "year": "2019", "title": "Visual Analytics of Taxi Trajectory Data via Topical Sub-trajectories", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Sichen Jin;Yubo Tao;Yuyu;Yuyu Yan;Jin Xu", "citationCount": "1", "affiliation": "Tao, YB (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab CAD\\&CG, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.\nJin, Sichen; Tao, Yubo; Yan, Yuyu; Xu, Jin; Lin, Hai, Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab CAD\\&CG, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.", "countries": "China", "abstract": "GPS-based taxi trajectories contain valuable knowledge about movement behaviors for transportation and urban planning.
