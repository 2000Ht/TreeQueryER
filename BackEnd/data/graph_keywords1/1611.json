With a pre-trained language representation model, the input natural language questions and table headers are first encoded into vectors. According to these vectors, a multi-task end-to-end deep neural network extracts the related data areas and the corresponding aggregation type.\nWe present the result with carefully designed visualization and annotations for different attribute types and tasks. We conducted a comparison experiment with state-of-the-art works and the best commercial tools. The results show that our method outperforms those works with higher accuracy and more effective visualization.", "doi": "advisorautomaticvisu-2021", "year": 2021, "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "citationCount": 0, "keywords": "", "link": "", "refList": "", "wos": 0, "len": 1}, "index": 1611, "embedding": [-1.8881237506866455, -0.26742973923683167, -1.0271400213241577, -0.31003087759017944, -0.1910475641489029, 0.16650904715061188, 4.877262115478516, 1.4302507638931274, 6.557957649230957, -0.6888176798820496, 2.1838364601135254, -0.9658841490745544, 0.08829163014888763, 1.8871333599090576, -0.6648035645484924, -0.5062769055366516, -0.03365722671151161, 0.0788058489561081, -0.22435054183006287, -0.0667189285159111, -0.06630208343267441, 0.33132481575012207, -0.2185245305299759, -0.114951491355896, -1.2825369834899902, 1.9319838285446167, -0.5328229665756226, -0.17058739066123962, -0.544016420841217, -2.594913959503174, 0.18127281963825226, -0.8552394509315491], "projection": [-1.0655043125152588, -19.240055084228516], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
