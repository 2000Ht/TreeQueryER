On the other hand, if the sampling frequency is below the Nyquist limit, the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice was demonstrated to be optimal in reducing the prealiasing effect. In this paper, we confirm that the FCC lattice is indeed optimal in this sense in a certain interval of the sampling frequency. By theoretically estimating the prealiasing error in a realistic range of the sampling frequency, we show that in other frequency intervals, the BCC lattice and even the traditional Cartesian Cubic (CC) lattice are expected to minimize the prealiasing. The BCC lattice is superior over the FCC lattice if the sampling frequency is not significantly below the Nyquist limit. Interestingly, if the original signal is drastically undersampled, the CC lattice is expected to provide the lowest prealiasing error. Additionally, we give a comprehensible clarification that the sampling efficiency of the FCC lattice is lower than that of the BCC lattice. Although this is a well-known fact, the exact percentage has been erroneously reported in the literature. Furthermore, for the sake of an unbiased comparison, we propose to rotate the Marschner-Lobb test signal such that an undue advantage is not given to either lattice.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12364", "refList": ["10.1016/j.cag.2010.02.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70429", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.115", "10.1109/tip.2011.2162421", "10.1016/s0019-9958(62)90633-2", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70414", "10.1109/tsp.2010.2051808", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.141", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.7", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.87", "10.1109/visual.1994.346331", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.234", "10.1109/visual.2001.964498", "10.1109/visual.2004.65", "10.1109/tit.2004.840864", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.37", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70573", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.230"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13437", "year": "2018", "title": "Cosine-Weighted B-Spline Interpolation on the Face-Centered Cubic Lattice", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Gergely R{\\'{a}}cz;Bal{\\'{a}}zs Cs{\\'{e}}bfalvi", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Racz, GF (Corresponding Author), Budapest Univ Technol \\& Econ, Budapest, Hungary.\nRacz, Gergely Ferenc; Csebfalvi, Balazs, Budapest Univ Technol \\& Econ, Budapest, Hungary.", "countries": "Hungary", "abstract": "Cosine-Weighted B-spline (CWB) interpolation {[}Cse13] has been originally proposed for volumetric data sampled on the Body-Centered Cubic (BCC) lattice.

However, the Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattice has been recently proven to be optimal for low-rate sampling. The CWB interpolation is a state-of-the-art technique on the BCC lattice, which outperforms, for example, the previously proposed box-spline interpolation in terms of both efficiency and visual quality.

In volume visualization, box splines are mainly used as reconstruction kernels that are easy to adapt to various sampling lattices, such as the Cartesian Cubic (CC), Body-Centered Cubic (BCC), and Face-Centered Cubic (FCC) lattices. The usual way of tailoring a box spline to a specific lattice is to span the box spline by exactly those principal directions that span the lattice itself. However, in this case, the preferred directions of the box spline and the lattice are the same, amplifying the anisotropic effects of each other. This leads to an anisotropic volume representation with strongly preferred directions. Therefore, in this paper, we retailor box splines to lattices such that the sets of vectors that span the box spline and the lattice are disjoint sets. As the preferred directions of the box spline and the lattice compensate each other, a more isotropic volume representation can be achieved. We demonstrate this by comparing different combinations of box splines and lattices concerning their anisotropic behavior in tomographic reconstruction and volume visualization.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12917", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2007.70429", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.115", "10.1109/42.875199", "10.1006/acha.1998.0249", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.37", "10.1016/0022-5193(70)90109-8", "10.1016/j.cag.2010.02.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.141", "10.1109/23.467854", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.87", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.130", "10.1109/tip.2007.891808", "10.1109/tsp.2010.2051808", "10.1109/visual.1994.346331", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.7", "10.1109/visual.2001.964498", "10.1109/2945.597800", "10.1111/cgf.12364", "10.1109/78.790659", "10.1109/icip.1999.817199", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70414", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.32", "10.1109/tip.2004.827231", "10.1109/swg.2002.1226515", "10.1109/visual.2004.70", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70573"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 5}, "index": 1236, "embedding": [1.4289898872375488, 0.08566540479660034, -0.897215723991394, 1.8565783500671387, 0.6075434684753418, 0.16650904715061188, -0.706787109375, 1.085404396057129, 1.690610647201538, 0.17396095395088196, 1.4426281452178955, 0.29057106375694275, 0.8858317136764526, 0.46994033455848694, -0.7231093645095825, -0.3789759874343872, 0.3357367217540741, 0.06482167541980743, -0.04182831197977066, 1.3863070011138916, -0.06630208343267441, -0.6113291382789612, -0.4434615671634674, -0.05504286289215088, -1.493083119392395, 0.6249668598175049, -0.5077023506164551, -0.17138656973838806, 1.0726772546768188, -1.6388555765151978, 0.21588477492332458, -0.12060487270355225], "projection": [-0.5691905617713928, 6.717070579528809], "size": 3, "height": 2, "width": 2}
