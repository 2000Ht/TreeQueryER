Design Considerations for Supporting Intent and Context in Analytical Conversation", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Melanie Tory;Vidya Setlur", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Tory, M (Corresponding Author), Tableau Software, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA. Tory, Melanie; Setlur, Vidya, Tableau Software, Palo Alto, CA 94306 USA.", "countries": "USA", "abstract": "Natural language can be a useful modality for creating and interacting with visualizations but users often have unrealistic expectations about the intelligence of natural language systems. The gulf between user expectations and system capabilities may lead to a disappointing user experience. So - if we want to engineer a natural language system, what are the requirements around system intelligence? This work takes a retrospective look at how we answered this question in the design of Ask Data, a natural language interaction feature for Tableau. We examine two factors contributing to perceived system intelligence: the system's ability to understand the analytic intent behind an input utterance and the ability to interpret an utterance contextually (i.e. taking into account the current visualization state and recent actions). Our aim was to understand the ways in which a system would need to support these two aspects of intelligence to enable a positive user experience. We first describe a pre-design Wizard of Oz study that offered insight into this question and narrowed the space of designs under consideration. We then reflect on the impact of this study on system development, examining how design implications from the study played out in practice. Our work contributes insights for the design of natural language interaction in visual analytics as well as a reflection on the value of pre-design empirical studies in the development of visual analytic systems.", "keywords": "Visualization,Empirical studies in visualization,Human-centered computing,Interaction paradigms,Natural language interfaces", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986918", "refList": ["10.1145/2505515.2505644", "10.1007/s00779-003-0253-8", "10.1109/infvis.2000.885092", "10.1145/1040830.1040869", "10.1145/3301275.3302270", "10.1016/j.ipm.2007.07.015", "10.4304/jltr.1.6.876-879", "10.1145/2449396.2449439", "10.1145/1060745.1060804", "10.1145/3025171.3025227", "10.1145/1502650.1502695", "10.1145/108360.108361", "10.3115/v1/n15", "10.1145/22949.22950", "10.1145/2449396.2449413", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744684", "10.1007/pl00011645", "10.1145/792550.792552", "10.1109/vast.2015.7347625", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745219", "10.1145/2043932.2043981", "10.1145/2348283.2348327", "10.1007/978-3-540-30192-9\\_58", "10.1145/2984511.2984588", "10.1145/5684.5687", "10.1007/s007790170019", "10.1109/icsc.2017.11", "10.1145/988672.988763", "10.1142/s0218213012500042", "10.3115/v1/n15-1020", "10.1145/2807442.2807478", "10.1093/applin/21.1.3", "10.1145/2047196.2047205", "10.1145/273035.273069", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467191", "10.1145/1772690.1772859", "10.1145/371920.371974"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13976", "year": "2020", "title": "Many At Once: Capturing Intentions to Create And Use Many Views At Once In Large Display Environments", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Jillian Aurisano;Abhinav Kumar;Abeer Alsaiari;Barbara Di Eugenio;Andrew E.

Participants were provided with a set of data exploration sub-tasks associated with a local crime dataset and were instructed to pose questions to a remote mediator who would respond by generating and organizing visualizations on the large display. We observed that participants frequently posed requests to cast a net around one or several subsets of the data or a set of data attributes. They accomplished this directly and by utilizing existing views in unique ways, including by requesting to copy and pivot a group of views collectively and posing a set of parallel requests on target views expressed in one command. These observed actions depart from multi-view flexible canvas environments that typically provide interfaces in support of generating one view at a time or actions that operate on one view at a time. We describe how participants used these `cast-a-net' requests for tasks that spanned more than one view and describe design considerations for multi-view environments that would support the observed multi-view generation actions.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13976", "refList": ["10.1109/vast47406.2019.8986918", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.166", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.275", "10.1177/0011000006287390", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346293", "10.1111/cgf.12106", "10.1109/visual.2005.1532788", "10.1145/2399016.2399102", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346260", "10.1145/3173574.3173593", "10.1145/2559206.2581202", "10.1111/cgf.12131", "10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2014.257337", "10.1145/2207676.2208293", "10.1145/2576099", "10.1145/1936652.1936676", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.163", "10.1109/mcg.2013.37", "10.1186/1471-2105-16-s11-s6", "10.1109/2945.981851", "10.1145/2807442.2807478", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.164", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2337337", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2743859", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.184", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467191", "10.1145/2702123.2702406", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.251", "10.1145/2702123.2702312", "10.1177/1473871611415997"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1211, "embedding": [0.174653097987175, -0.027589479461312294, -0.9959474802017212, 0.2438737154006958, 0.20721688866615295, 0.16650904715061188, -0.700136661529541, 0.8952966332435608, 0.783922553062439, 0.2304927110671997, 0.37629666924476624, -0.19267041981220245, 0.028027325868606567, -0.8313950896263123, -0.678647518157959, -0.42431628704071045, 0.20212477445602417, 0.08175134658813477, -0.6280290484428406, 0.4027058184146881, -0.06630208343267441, -0.3677889108657837, -0.8347665071487427, 0.07860852777957916, -1.3661270141601562, 0.09129026532173157, -0.5500518083572388, -0.16255053877830505, 0.6758127212524414, -1.555513620376587, -0.31845611333847046, -0.40616706013679504], "projection": [-1.7735066413879395, 8.588610649108887], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
