Our results include statistically significant differences, suggesting that MetroSets performs and scales better.", "doi": "onthereadabilityofab-2021", "year": 2021, "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "citationCount": 0, "keywords": "", "link": "", "refList": "", "wos": 0, "len": 1}, "index": 1628, "embedding": [-2.195723295211792, -0.27671948075294495, -1.0741424560546875, -0.46540987491607666, -0.3531380295753479, 0.16650904715061188, 5.275195121765137, 1.4510211944580078, 5.842199802398682, -0.7255211472511292, 2.0926268100738525, -1.0485965013504028, -0.022241393104195595, 1.9239401817321777, -0.7502163648605347, -0.5597680807113647, -0.13456156849861145, 0.06402745097875595, -0.27343806624412537, 0.21524885296821594, -0.06630208343267441, 0.6598920226097107, -0.06621173024177551, -0.13563132286071777, -1.2986860275268555, 2.407768964767456, -0.5670700073242188, -0.18801918625831604, -0.5601260662078857, -2.6500608921051025, 0.1974087357521057, -0.9427592754364014], "projection": [5.722110271453857, -8.364797592163086], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
