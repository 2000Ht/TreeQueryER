They are widely used by coaches, managers, journalists and fans in general. There are situations where diagrams may be hard to understand, for example, when several actions are packed in a certain region of the field or there are just too many actions to be transformed in a clear depiction of the play. The representation of how actions develop through time, in particular, may be hardly achieved on such diagrams. The time, and the relationship among the actions of the players through time, is critical on the depiction of complex plays. In this context, we present a study on how player actions may be clearly depicted on 2D diagrams. The study is focused on Baseball plays, a sport where diagrams are heavily used to summarize the actions of the players. We propose a new and simple approach to represent spatiotemporal information in the form of a timeline. We designed our visualization with a requirement driven approach, conducting interviews and fulfilling the needs of baseball experts and expert-fans. We validate our approach by presenting a detailed analysis of baseball plays and conducting interviews with four domain experts.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13436", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2012.225", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.192", "10.1109/visual.2001.964496", "10.1111/cgf.13189", "10.1109/mcg.2016.102", "10.1109/mcg.2016.101", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.263", "10.1109/mcg.2016.124", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500178", "10.1111/j.1435-5597.1970.tb01464.x", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042478", "10.1515/jqas-2014-0089", "10.1007/s13218-012-0177-4"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934243", "title": "CourtTime: Generating Actionable Insights into Tennis Matches Using Visual Analytics", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Tom Polk;Dominik J\u00e4ckle;Johannes H\u00e4ussler;Jing Yang", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Polk, T (Corresponding Author), Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany.

Summary statistics alone are inadequate to provide the insights players need to improve their games. Spatio-temporal data capturing player and ball movements is likely to provide the actionable insights needed to identify player strengths, weaknesses, and strategies. To fully utilize this spatio-temporal data, we need to integrate it with domain-relevant context meta-data. In this paper, we propose CourtTime, a novel approach to perform data-driven visual analysis of individual tennis matches. Our visual approach introduces a novel visual metaphor, namely 1\u2013D Space-Time Charts that enable the analysis of single points at a glance based on small multiples. We also employ user-driven sorting and clustering techniques and a layout technique that aligns the last few shots in a point to facilitate shot pattern discovery.

We propose a well-established hybrid second-order Markov chain model to characterize and simulate the competition process in table tennis. Compared with existing methods, our approach is the first to support the effective simulation of tactics, which represent high-level competition strategies in table tennis. Furthermore, we introduce a visual analytics system called Tac-Simur based on the proposed model for simulative visual analytics. Tac-Simur enables users to easily navigate different players and their tactics based on their respective performance in matches to identify the player and the tactics of interest for further analysis. Then, users can utilize the system to interactively explore diverse simulation tasks and visually explain the simulation results. The effectiveness and usefulness of this work are demonstrated by two case studies, in which domain experts utilize Tac-Simur to find interesting and valuable insights. The domain experts also provide positive feedback on the usability of Tac-Simur.

However, these ranking algorithms have a variety of sensitivities, and even small changes in rank can lead to vast reductions in product sales and page hits. As such, there is a need for tools and methods that can help model developers and analysts explore the sensitivities of graph ranking algorithms with respect to perturbations within the graph structure.

However, as the scale and complexity of these event sequences grows, even these visualizations can become overwhelming to use. In this paper, we propose the use of textual narratives as a data-driven storytelling method to augment causality visualization. We first propose a design space for how textual narratives can be used to describe causal data. We then present results from a crowdsourced user study where participants were asked to recover causality information from two causality visualizations-causal graphs and Hasse diagrams-with and without an associated textual narrative. Finally, we describe Causeworks, a causality visualization system for understanding how specific interventions influence a causal model.
