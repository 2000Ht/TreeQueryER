However, current state-of-the-art isosurfacing algorithms usually consume large amounts of GPU memory owing to the additional acceleration structures they require. As a result, the continued limitations on available GPU memory mean that they are unable to deal with the larger datasets that are now increasingly becoming prevalent. This paper proposes a new parallel isosurface-extraction algorithm that exploits the blocked organisation of the parallel threads found in modern many-core platforms to achieve fast isosurface extraction and reduce the associated memory requirements. This is achieved by optimising thread co-operation within thread-blocks and reducing redundant computation; ultimately, an indexed triangular mesh can be produced. Experiments have shown that the proposed algorithm is much faster (up to 10x) than state-of-the-art GPU algorithms and has a much smaller memory footprint, enabling it to handle much larger datasets (up to 64x) on the same GPU.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12897", "refList": ["10.1145/130881.130882", "10.1145/37402.37422", "10.1007/s00371-008-0215-2", "10.1109/2945.489388", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.161", "10.1007/s00371-014-0924-7", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.113", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2010.01825.x", "10.1109/ldav.2015.7348069", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01182.x", "10.1111/cgf.12462", "10.1016/j.cag.2006.07.021", "10.1111/cgf.12083", "10.1145/1851476.1851553", "10.1007/s00371-008-0261-9"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1342, "embedding": [-2.1405532360076904, -0.30501702427864075, -1.0404996871948242, -0.3397044837474823, -0.15341229736804962, 0.16650904715061188, 4.232699394226074, 1.594744086265564, 6.664301872253418, -0.734541118144989, 2.690857410430908, -1.096014142036438, 0.05267440527677536, 2.031601905822754, -0.99098140001297, -0.5263585448265076, -0.1782408505678177, 0.06877747178077698, -0.3328309655189514, 0.07801923155784607, -0.06630208343267441, 0.5523685812950134, -0.18430595099925995, -0.1691095381975174, -1.166448950767517, 2.8945698738098145, -0.5834015607833862, -0.21145495772361755, -0.5749752521514893, -2.775730609893799, 0.1861349195241928, -0.9660730957984924], "projection": [3.4339122772216797, 25.111045837402344], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
