Despite this importance, the type of aggregation is often communicated only via axis titles. In this paper, we investigate the use of animation to disambiguate different types of aggregation and communicate the meaning of aggregate operations. We present design rationales for animated transitions depicting aggregate operations and present the results of an experiment assessing the impact of these different transitions on identification tasks. We find that judiciously staged animated transitions can improve subjects' accuracy at identifying the aggregation performed, though sometimes with longer response times than with static transitions. Through an analysis of participants' rankings and qualitative responses, we find a consistent preference for animation over static transitions and highlight visual features subjects report relying on to make their judgments. We conclude by extending our animation designs to more complex charts of aggregated data such as box plots and bootstrapped confidence intervals.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13709", "refList": ["10.1111/cgf.13408", "10.1006/ijhc.1017", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346424", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.227", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2785807", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.175", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2750689", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.125", "10.1006/ijhc.2002.1017", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70539", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864884", "10.1006/s1045-926x(02)00028-9", "10.1109/infvis.1999.801854"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030396", "title": "What Makes a Data-GIF Understandable?", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Xinhuan Shu;Aoyu Wu;Junxiu Tang;Benjamin Bach;Yingcai Wu;Huamin Qu", "citationCount": "1", "affiliation": "Wu, YC (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Univ, State Key Lab CAD\\&CG, Hangzhou, Peoples R China.

In this paper, we ask the question, \u201cWhat makes a data-GIF understandable?\u201d While other storytelling formats such as data videos, infographics, or data comics are relatively well studied, we have little knowledge about the design factors and principles for \u201cdata-GIFs\u201d. To close this gap, we provide results from semi-structured interviews and an online study with a total of 118 participants investigating the impact of design decisions on the understandability of data-GIFs. The study and our consequent analysis are informed by a systematic review and structured design space of 108 data-GIFs that we found online. Our results show the impact of design dimensions from our design space such as animation encoding, context preservation, or repetition on viewers understanding of the GIF's core message.

By leveraging data-enriched SVG charts, its grammar of animations can be applied to the charts created by existing chart construction tools. With Canis, designers can select marks from the charts, partition the selected marks into mark units based on data attributes, and apply animation effects to the mark units, with the control of when the effects start. The Canis compiler automatically synthesizes the Lottie animation JSON files {[}Aira], which can be rendered natively across multiple platforms. To demonstrate Canis' expressiveness, we present a wide range of chart animations. We also evaluate its scalability by showing the effectiveness of our compiler in reducing the output specification size and comparing its performance on different platforms against D3.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14005", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598647", "10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098", "10.1111/cgf.13709", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.78", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346424", "10.1145/3173574.3173697", "10.1111/cgf.13178", "10.1006/ijhc.1017", "10.1145/3025453.3025942", "10.1145/2702123.2702431", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.125", "10.1006/ijhc.2002.1017", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70539", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599030.2", "10.1145/2642918.2647411", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.174"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 5}, "index": 1525, "embedding": [1.3732558488845825, 0.12575702369213104, -0.3120797276496887, 1.631123661994934, 0.19354456663131714, 0.16650904715061188, -0.7167134881019592, 0.7079863548278809, 0.33020302653312683, -0.12427376210689545, 0.8197916150093079, -0.009556891396641731, -0.13702842593193054, -0.024416077882051468, -0.6648035645484924, 0.49115726351737976, -0.023407986387610435, 0.0788058489561081, -0.5047567486763, 2.079223155975342, -0.06630208343267441, 0.11880616098642349, 0.046395473182201385, 0.12225484848022461, -1.4761536121368408, 0.5585917830467224, -0.5328229665756226, -0.17058739066123962, 1.0543943643569946, -1.0493708848953247, -0.09791512787342072, -0.06929709017276764], "projection": [-1.2678534984588623, 7.0681915283203125], "size": 3, "height": 2, "width": 2}
