It recursively coarsens a graph and then uncoarsens the drawing using layout refinement. In this paper, we leverage the Louvain community detection algorithm for the multilevel graph drawing paradigm.\nMore specifically, we present the Louvain-based multi-level graph drawing algorithm, and compare with other community detection algorithms such as Label Propagation and Infomap clustering. Experiments show that Louvain-based multi-level algorithm performs best in terms of efficiency (i.e., fastest runtime), while Label Propagation and Infomap-based multi-level algorithms perform better in terms of effectiveness (i.e., better visualization in quality metrics).", "doi": "louvainbasedmultilev-2021", "year": 2021, "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "citationCount": 0, "keywords": "", "link": "", "refList": "", "wos": 0, "len": 1}, "index": 1624, "embedding": [-1.8541600704193115, -0.2658282518386841, -1.0222129821777344, -0.3281642496585846, -0.256539911031723, 0.16650904715061188, 4.7942728996276855, 1.279591679573059, 5.636180400848389, -0.6998878121376038, 2.036039352416992, -1.0090699195861816, 0.07087843865156174, 1.8110952377319336, -0.7281984686851501, -0.5191090106964111, -0.13345125317573547, 0.07000205665826797, -0.2538405656814575, 0.19619973003864288, -0.06630208343267441, 0.4119381308555603, -0.17166398465633392, -0.1290702521800995, -1.3461343050003052, 2.033021926879883, -0.5019459128379822, -0.1698274314403534, -0.5375044941902161, -2.587571859359741, 0.11914713680744171, -0.8862587213516235], "projection": [14.217583656311035, -9.781031608581543], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
