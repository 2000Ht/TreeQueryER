Yet, existing measures of perceptual precision for data channels (e.g., position, length, orientation, etc.) are based largely on verbal reports of ratio judgments between two values (e.g., [7]). Verbal report conflates multiple sources of error beyond actual visual precision, introducing a ratio computation between these values and a requirement to translate that ratio to a verbal number. Here we observe raw measures of precision by eliminating both ratio computations and verbal reports; we simply ask participants to reproduce marks (a single bar or dot) to match a previously seen one. We manipulated whether the mark was initially presented (and later drawn) alone, paired with a reference (e.g. a second \u2018100%\u2019 bar also present at test, or a y-axis for the dot), or integrated with the reference (merging that reference bar into a stacked bar graph, or placing the dot directly on the axis). Reproductions of smaller values were overestimated, and larger values were underestimated, suggesting systematic memory biases. Average reproduction error was around 10% of the actual value, regardless of whether the reproduction was done on a common baseline with the original. In the reference and (especially) the integrated conditions, responses were repulsed from an implicit midpoint of the reference mark, such that values above 50% were overestimated, and values below 50% were underestimated. This reproduction paradigm may serve within a new suite of more fundamental measures of the precision of graphical perception.", "keywords": "Cognition and perception,Graphical perception,Perceptual biases,Ratio perception", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030345", "refList": ["10.2307/2288843", "10.1167/14.8.23", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.196", "10.1037/xge0000076", "10.1037/0096-3445.137.2.348", "10.1163/156856897x00357", "10.1109/6.736450", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744198", "10.1177/0956797610397956", "10.1037/0096-3445.114.4.451", "10.1002/9781119055259", "10.1037//0096-3445.129.2.220", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.186", "10.1007/s00426-006-0077-z", "10.1109/infvis.2001.963283", "10.18637/jss.v067.i01", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934400", "10.1371/journal.pone.0015293", "10.2307/2288400", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.163", "10.1145/3231772", "10.1037/a0020413", "10.1163/156856897x00366", "10.1037/0033-295x.98.3.352"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1001, "embedding": [-0.2763691544532776, 0.1655624359846115, -1.0271400213241577, -2.217207670211792, -0.6604432463645935, 0.16650904715061188, -0.7167134881019592, 0.5385750532150269, -0.43251052498817444, -0.6840996146202087, 0.15288330614566803, -0.7580409049987793, -0.13702842593193054, -0.9811441898345947, 0.35129514336586, 0.34531545639038086, -0.012873710133135319, 0.0788058489561081, -0.006673380266875029, 0.4584667682647705, -0.06630208343267441, -0.18717065453529358, -0.15811164677143097, -0.114951491355896, -2.4801409244537354, 0.10712844133377075, -0.3565612733364105, -0.1155153214931488, -0.10663577914237976, 1.4743441343307495, -0.2105157971382141, 0.07134100794792175], "projection": [3.2495172023773193, 3.768209218978882], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
