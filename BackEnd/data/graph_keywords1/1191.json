Unlike previous systems that focus on showing statistics and build order, our system can depict the most important part - battles in the games. Specifically, we visualize detailed movements of armies belonging to respective nations on a map and enable users to examine battles from a global view to a local view. In the global view, battles are depicted by curved arrows revealing how the armies enter and escape from the battlefield. By observing the arrows and the height map, users can make sense of offensive and defensive strategies easily. In the local view, units of each type are rendered on the map, and their movements are represented by animation. We also render an attack line between a pair of units if one of them can attack the other to help users analyze the advantages and disadvantages of a particular formation. Accordingly, users can utilize our system to discover statistics, build order, and battles, and learn strategies from games played by professionals.", "keywords": "real-time strategy games,StarCraft,game visualization,trajectories", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2017.8585594", "refList": ["10.1145/2207676.2208558", "10.1145/2381876.2381878", "10.1109/tciaig.2015.2487743", "10.1109/infvis.2000.885098", "10.1109/ijcnn.2008.4634237", "10.1109/tciaig.2016.2544817"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00021", "year": "2019", "title": "Visual Analytics of Dynamic Interplay Between Behaviors in MMORPGs", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Junhua Lu;Xiao Xie;Ji Lan;Tai{-}Quan Peng;Wei Chen;Yingcai Wu", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Chen, W; Wu, YC (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.\nLu, Junhua; Xie, Xiao; Lan, Ji; Chen, Wei; Wu, Yingcai, Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.\nPeng, Tai-Quan, Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.", "countries": "USA;China", "abstract": "The rapid development of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) has led operators to record huge amounts of fine-grained data from the in-game activities of players. These data provide considerable opportunities with which to study the dynamic interplay among player behaviors and investigate the roles of various social structures that underlie such interplay. However, modeling and visualizing these behavioral data remain a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel influence-susceptible model to measure the dynamic interplay among multiple behaviors. Based on this model, we introduce a new visual analytics system called BeXplorer. BeXplorer enables analysts to interactively explore the dynamic interplay between player purchase and communication behaviors and to examine the manner in which this interplay is bound by social structures where players are embedded.", "keywords": "Human-centered computing; Visualization; Visualization application domains; Visual analytics", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis.2019.00021", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2015.2509990", "10.1108/s0733-558x(2014)0000040008", "10.1016/j.chb.2016.12.043", "10.1109/tciaig.2010.2072506", "10.1093/restud/rdq014", "10.1016/0304-4076(77)90008-2", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.221", "10.1007/bf02476440", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585594", "10.1086/599247", "10.1002/wics.101", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467621", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816203", "10.2307/2118364", "10.2307/2281644", "10.1177/0049124193022001006", "10.1111/cgf.12888", "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031576", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.225", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.225", "10.1109/pacificvis.2015.7156367", "10.1177/1461444809105346", "10.1103/physrevlett.89.208701", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2534558", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346919", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598415", "10.1109/pacificvis.2016.7465266", "10.1109/pacificvis.2015.7156376", "10.1126/science.1215842", "10.1177/0049124111404820", "10.2307/2289447", "10.1073/pnas.1004008107", "10.1109/infvis.2000.885098", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00026", "10.1146/annurev-soc-071913-043145"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1191, "embedding": [0.1317046731710434, 0.6758022904396057, 0.35709935426712036, 1.6043583154678345, -0.6737499833106995, 0.16650904715061188, 0.2505504786968231, 1.8698949813842773, -0.4176805317401886, -0.8126697540283203, 0.1166912242770195, 0.4824850559234619, -0.13027368485927582, 1.6984360218048096, 0.5497894883155823, 0.9697887897491455, -0.1716480255126953, 0.07420150190591812, -0.6413080096244812, -0.4176645576953888, -0.06630208343267441, 2.0594608783721924, 0.018801186233758926, -0.13057257235050201, 0.532864511013031, 0.09751410037279129, -0.5483691096305847, 0.06975515931844711, 1.5496008396148682, -0.6912944912910461, 0.16767646372318268, 0.783778727054596], "projection": [-4.5680694580078125, 7.226986885070801], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
