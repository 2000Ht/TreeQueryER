However, many real-world problems like environment pollution forecasting apply RNNs on sequences of multi-dimensional data where each dimension represents an individual feature with semantic meaning such as PM2.5 and SO2. RNN interpretation on multi-dimensional sequences is challenging as users need to analyze what features are important at different time steps to better understand model behavior and gain trust in prediction. This requires effective and scalable visualization methods to reveal the complex many-to-many relations between hidden units and features. In this work, we propose a visual analytics system to interpret RNNs on multi-dimensional time-series forecasts. Specifically, to provide an overview to reveal the model mechanism, we propose a technique to estimate the hidden unit response by measuring how different feature selections affect the hidden unit output distribution. We then cluster the hidden units and features based on the response embedding vectors. Finally, we propose a visual analytics system which allows users to visually explore the model behavior from the global and individual levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with case studies using air pollutant forecast applications.", "keywords": "interpretable machine learning; recurrent neural networks; multi-dimensional time series; air pollutant forecast", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.2785", "refList": ["10.1109/78.650093", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585721", "10.1162/neco\\_a\\_01134", "10.1016/0950-7051(96)81920-4", "10.1111/cgf.12878", "10.1145/2783258.2788573", "10.1145/2939672.2939778", "10.1038/s41467-017-01689-9", "10.1109/cvpr.2015.7298907", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865044", "10.5555/2969239.2969329", "10.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-7", "10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735", "10.1214/aos/1013203451", "10.5555/3295222.3295230", "10.1109/icstcc.2016.7790762", "10.1016/s1352-2310(02)01002-6", "10.1016/j.atmosenv.2004.11.017", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744158", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865027", "10.1007/978-3-319-21233-3\\_6", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744358", "10.3115/v1/d14-1179", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030370", "title": "TaxThemis: Interactive Mining and Exploration of Suspicious Tax Evasion Groups", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Yating Lin;Kamkwai Wong;Yong Wang;Rong Zhang;Bo Dong;Huamin Qu;Qinghua Zheng", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Lin, YT (Corresponding Author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, MOEKLINNS Lab, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

Recent research has applied data analytics techniques to analyze and detect tax evasion behaviors of individual taxpayers. However, they have failed to support the analysis and exploration of the related party transaction tax evasion (RPTTE) behaviors (e.g., transfer pricing), where a group of taxpayers is involved. In this paper, we present TaxThemis, an interactive visual analytics system to help tax officers mine and explore suspicious tax evasion groups through analyzing heterogeneous tax-related data. A taxpayer network is constructed and fused with the respective trade network to detect suspicious RPTTE groups. Rich visualizations are designed to facilitate the exploration and investigation of suspicious transactions between related taxpayers with profit and topological data analysis. Specifically, we propose a calendar heatmap with a carefully-designed encoding scheme to intuitively show the evidence of transferring revenue through related party transactions. We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of TaxThemis through two case studies on real-world tax-related data and interviews with domain experts.", "keywords": "Visual Analytics,Tax Network,Tax Evasion Detection,Anomaly detection,Multidimensional data", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030370", "refList": ["10.1111/cgf.12886", "10.2307/2277827", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.44", "10.1109/tits.2014.2315794", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934670", "10.1038/s41467-019-08987-4", "10.1111/cgf.12920", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585721", "10.1080/15230406.2015.1093431", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2843369", "10.1038/srep01001", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744018", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744159", "10.1068/b130199p", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.143", "10.1016/j.visinf.2017.01.006", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2892483", "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031583", "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.2785", "10.2307/2686111", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467199", "10.1111/cgf.12114", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865126", "10.1111/j.1538-4632.1996.tb00936.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934619", "10.2307/2332142", "10.1007/978-3-319-10590-1\\_53", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.485", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.17", "10.2307/2986645", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346321", "10.1017/s0140525x16001837", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598541", "10.1371/journal.pone.0207377", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346265", "10.1007/s4095-020-0191-7", "10.3141/1644-14", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744158", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865027", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2785807", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744358", "10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00338.x", "10.1080/03081068808717359", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 264, "embedding": [0.4099162220954895, -0.26493993401527405, 1.5825504064559937, 1.282755732536316, -0.6495316028594971, 0.16650904715061188, -0.7182635068893433, -0.7391681671142578, -0.4013857841491699, -0.8018340468406677, -0.031098078936338425, -0.39446914196014404, -0.1336275339126587, -0.2648356258869171, 1.0495144128799438, -0.2902427613735199, 0.26396963000297546, 0.07991757988929749, 0.15533991158008575, 1.18599534034729, -0.06630208343267441, -0.37101104855537415, -0.06715520471334457, -0.13207590579986572, 0.326554536819458, 0.09441477060317993, -0.5399249196052551, -0.17674389481544495, -0.5434138178825378, 1.6966676712036133, 0.5511273145675659, 0.257376492023468], "projection": [-3.4091827869415283, 5.048943996429443], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
