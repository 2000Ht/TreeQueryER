Traditional curricula that focused on conveying research-derived knowledge are slowly integrating design thinking as a key learning objective. In part, this is motivated by the realization that infovis is a wicked design problem, requiring a different kind of design work. In this paper we describe, VizItCards, a card-driven workshop developed for our graduate infovis class. The workshop is intended to provide practice with good design techniques and to simultaneously reinforce key concepts. VizItCards relies on principles of collaborative-learning and research on parallel design to generate positive collaborations and high-quality designs. From our experience of simulating a realistic design scenario in a classroom setting, we find that our students were able to meet key learning objectives and their design performance improved during the class. We describe variants of the workshop, discussing which techniques we think match to which learning goals.", "keywords": "information visualization education;peer learning;toolkit;card;design workshop", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2599338", "refList": ["10.1145/2508859.2516753", "10.2312/eurovisstar.20141170", "10.1109/mcg.2012.55", "10.1109/infvis.1996.559229", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346331", "10.1109/mcg.2007.156", "10.1145/2499947.2499948", "10.1109/38.595272", "10.1007/978-3-642-31991-4", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70515", "10.1145/22949.22950", "10.1109/hicss.2014.377", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.184", "10.1109/mcg.2013.101", "10.1016/0193-3973(84)90006-6", "10.1109/38.851744", "10.1111/cgf.12618", "10.1016/s0926-5805(99)00025-4", "10.1145/2858036.2858280", "10.1109/vast.2009.5333245", "10.2307/1511637", "10.1076/csed.13.3.191.14945", "10.1016/0883-0355(89)90013-x", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467271", "10.1145/1879831.1879836", "10.1007/bf01405730", "10.1007/978-3-540-70956-5\\_4", "10.1145/1823818.1823821", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1145/2702123.2702142", "10.1109/mcg.2013.57", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1145/2858036.2858558", "10.1080/0260293990240405", "10.1016/j.compedu.2012.12.020"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745878", "title": "The Explanatory Visualization Framework: An Active Learning Framework for Teaching Creative Computing Using Explanatory Visualizations", "year": "2017", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Jonathan Roberts 0002;Panagiotis D.

The increasing size of CNN models, however, prevents them from being widely deployed to devices with limited computational resources, e.g., mobile/embedded devices. The emerging topic of model pruning strives to address this problem by removing less important neurons and fine-tuning the pruned networks to minimize the accuracy loss. Nevertheless, existing automated pruning solutions often rely on a numerical threshold of the pruning criteria, lacking the flexibility to optimally balance the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, the complicated interplay between the stages of neuron pruning and model fine-tuning makes this process opaque, and therefore becomes difficult to optimize. In this paper, we address these challenges through a visual analytics approach, named CNNPruner. It considers the importance of convolutional filters through both instability and sensitivity, and allows users to interactively create pruning plans according to a desired goal on model size or accuracy. Also, CNNPruner integrates state-of-the-art filter visualization techniques to help users understand the roles that different filters played and refine their pruning plans.

To author interactive visualizations, users must instead turn to textual specification, but such approaches impose a higher technical burden.

Users perform an interaction (e.g., button clicks, drags, or key presses) directly on the visualization they are editing. The system interprets this performance using a set of heuristics and enumerates suggestions of possible interaction designs. These heuristics account for the properties of the interaction (e.g., target and event type) as well as the visualization (e.g., mark and scale types, and multiple views). Interaction design suggestions are displayed as thumbnails; users can preview and test these suggestions, iteratively refine them through additional demonstrations, and finally apply and customize them via property inspectors. We evaluate our approach through a gallery of diverse examples, and evaluate its usability through a first-use study and via an analysis of its cognitive dimensions.

Because of its generalizability, the MV design has been widely adopted by the visualization community to help users examine and interact with large, complex, and high-dimensional data. However, although ubiquitous, there has been little work to categorize and analyze MVs in order to better understand its design space. As a result, there has been little to no guideline in how to use the MV design effectively. In this paper, we present an in-depth study of how MVs are designed in practice. We focus on two fundamental measures of multiple-view patterns: composition, which quantifies what view types and how many are there; and configuration, which characterizes spatial arrangement of view layouts in the display space. We build a new dataset containing 360 images of MVs collected from IEEE VIS, EuroVis, and PacificVis publications 2011 to 2019, and make fine-grained annotations of view types and layouts for these visualization images. From this data we conduct composition and configuration analyses using quantitative metrics of term frequency and layout topology. We identify common practices around MVs, including relationship of view types, popular view layouts, and correlation between view types and layouts.

From this interpretivist position we explore the nature of visualization design study and develop six criteria for rigor. We propose that rigor is established and judged according to the extent to which visualization design study research and its reporting are INFORMED, REFLEXIVE, ABUNDANT, PLAUSIBLE, RESONANT, and TRANSPARENT. This perspective and the criteria were constructed through a four-year engagement with the discourse around rigor and the nature of knowledge in social science, information systems, and design. We suggest methods from cognate disciplines that can support visualization researchers in meeting these criteria during the planning, execution, and reporting of design study. Through a series of deliberately provocative questions, we explore implications of this new perspective for design study research in visualization, concluding that as a discipline, visualization is not yet well positioned to embrace, nurture, and fully benefit from a rigorous, interpretivist approach to design study.

Computational tools, such as dimensionality reduction (DR) and classification, are commonly used to efficiently process the multidimensional space of features. These underlying calculations often hinder interpretability of results and prevent experts from assessing the impact of individual molecular features on the resulting representations. To provide a solution for scrutinizing such complex data, we introduce ChemVA, an interactive application for the visual exploration of large molecular ensembles and their features. Our tool consists of multiple coordinated views: Hexagonal view, Detail view, 3D view, Table view, and a newly proposed Difference view designed for the comparison of DR projections. These views display DR projections combined with biological activity, selected molecular features, and confidence scores for each of these projections. This conjunction of views allows the user to drill down through the dataset and to efficiently select candidate compounds. Our approach was evaluated on two case studies of finding structurally similar ligands with similar binding affinity to a target protein, as well as on an external qualitative evaluation. The results suggest that our system allows effective visual inspection and comparison of different high-dimensional molecular representations. Furthermore, ChemVA assists in the identification of candidate compounds while providing information on the certainty behind different molecular representations.", "keywords": "Virtual screening,visual analysis,dimensionality reduction,coordinated views,cheminformatics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030438", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2008.137", "10.1057/ivs.2009.10", "10.2312/eurovisstar.20151110", "10.1109/eisic.2015.35", "10.1109/pacificvis.2014.44", "10.1145/1142473.1142574", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.223", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346573", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.1111/cgf.13717", "10.1109/vizsec.2009.5375536", "10.1111/cgf.12925", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467551", "10.1109/mcg.2015.99", "10.1007/978-3-319", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.255", "10.1145/1064830.1064834", "10.1177/1473871611433713", "10.1207/s1532690xci0804\\_2", "10.1145/1168149.1168168", "10.1016/j.chb.2006.10.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346441", "10.1109/eisic.2017.15", "10.1111/1467-8721.00160", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865024", "10.1109/infvis.2004.2"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030435", "title": "Data Visceralization: Enabling Deeper Understanding of Data Using Virtual Reality", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Benjamin Lee;Dave Brown;Bongshin Lee;Christophe Hurter;Steven Mark Drucker;Tim Dwyer", "citationCount": "1", "affiliation": "Lee, B (Corresponding Author), Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.

While this abstraction is a powerful basis for data visualization, the connection between the representation and the original underlying data (i.e., what the quantities and measurements actually correspond with in reality) can be lost. On the other hand, virtual reality (VR) is being increasingly used to represent real and abstract models as natural experiences to users. In this work, we explore the potential of using VR to help restore the basic understanding of units and measures that are often abstracted away in data visualization in an approach we call data visceralization. By building VR prototypes as design probes, we identify key themes and factors for data visceralization. We do this first through a critical reflection by the authors, then by involving external participants. We find that data visceralization is an engaging way of understanding the qualitative aspects of physical measures and their real-life form, which complements analytical and quantitative understanding commonly gained from data visualization. However, data visceralization is most effective when there is a one-to-one mapping between data and representation, with transformations such as scaling affecting this understanding.

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game - one with narrative elements and one without - and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game.

During this design study we experimented with methods to support three of the rigor criteria: ABUNDANT, REFLEXIVE, and TRANSPARENT. As a result we contribute two novel visualization techniques for the analysis of multivariate phylogenetic datasets, three methodological recommendations for conducting design studies drawn from reflections over our process of experimentation, and two writing devices for reporting interpretivist design study.

To better understand the needs of this user group, we conduct a technical observation study of 50 public repositories of data and analysis code authored by 33 professional journalists at 26 news organizations. We develop two detailed and cross-cutting taxonomies of data wrangling in computational journalism, for actions and for processes. We observe the extensive use of multiple tables, a notable gap in previous wrangling analyses. We develop a concise, actionable framework for general multi-table data wrangling that includes wrangling operations documented in our taxonomy that are without clear parallels in other work. This framework, the first to incorporate tables as first-class objects, will support future interactive wrangling tools for both computational journalism and general-purpose use.

These efforts provide scientific grounding to complement design intuitions, leading to more effective visualization practice. However, published visualization research currently reflects a limited set of available methods for understanding how people process visualized data. Alternative methods from vision science offer a rich suite of tools for understanding visualizations, but no curated collection of these methods exists in either perception or visualization research. We introduce a design space of experimental methods for empirically investigating the perceptual processes involved with viewing data visualizations to ultimately inform visualization design guidelines. This paper provides a shared lexicon for facilitating experimental visualization research. We discuss popular experimental paradigms, adjustment types, response types, and dependent measures used in vision science research, rooting each in visualization examples.

In recent work we proposed a new, interpretivist perspective on design study and six companion criteria for rigor that highlight the opportunities for researchers to contribute knowledge that extends beyond visualization idioms and software. In this work we conducted a year-long collaboration with evolutionary biologists to develop an interactive tool for visual exploration of multivariate datasets and phylogenetic trees. During this design study we experimented with methods to support three of the rigor criteria: ABUNDANT, REFLEXIVE, and TRANSPARENT. As a result we contribute two novel visualization techniques for the analysis of multivariate phylogenetic datasets, three methodological recommendations for conducting design studies drawn from reflections over our process of experimentation, and two writing devices for reporting interpretivist design study.

While this abstraction is a powerful basis for data visualization, the connection between the representation and the original underlying data (i.e., what the quantities and measurements actually correspond with in reality) can be lost. On the other hand, virtual reality (VR) is being increasingly used to represent real and abstract models as natural experiences to users. In this work, we explore the potential of using VR to help restore the basic understanding of units and measures that are often abstracted away in data visualization in an approach we call data visceralization. By building VR prototypes as design probes, we identify key themes and factors for data visceralization. We do this first through a critical reflection by the authors, then by involving external participants. We find that data visceralization is an engaging way of understanding the qualitative aspects of physical measures and their real-life form, which complements analytical and quantitative understanding commonly gained from data visualization. However, data visceralization is most effective when there is a one-to-one mapping between data and representation, with transformations such as scaling affecting this understanding. We conclude with a discussion of future directions for data visceralization.", "keywords": "Data visceralization,virtual reality,exploratory study", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030435", "refList": ["10.1080/01973762.2013.761106", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467811", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.221", "10.1145/3284179.3284326", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934287", "10.1109/2945.841119", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.1109/mcg.2013.101", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.175", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2830759", "10.1109/3dvis.2014.7160096", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2878900", "10.1109/iv.2011.32", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.196", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865241", "10.1515/abitech-2017-0002", "10.1145/2468356.2468739", "10.16995/olh.280", "10.1080/15230406.2018.1513343", "10.1109/iv.2004.1320189", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1109/mcg.2006.120", "10.1109/icdar.2017.286", "10.1371/journal.pone.0146368", "10.1080/1472586x.2011.548488", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346574", "10.1080/0013838x.2017.1332021"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030355", "title": "Guidelines For Pursuing and Revealing Data Abstractions", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Alex Bigelow;Katy Williams;Katherine E.

However, we find limited discussion and empirical measurement of peer review in visualization coursework. In addition to engagement, peer review provides direct and diverse feedback and reinforces recently-learned course concepts through critical evaluation of others' work. In this paper, we discuss the construction and application of peer review in a computer science visualization course, including: projects that reuse code and visualizations in a feedback-guided, continual improvement process and a peer review rubric to reinforce key course concepts. To measure the effectiveness of the approach, we evaluate student projects, peer review text, and a post-course questionnaire from 3 semesters of mixed undergraduate and graduate courses. The results indicate that course concepts are reinforced with peer review-82\\% reported learning more because of peer review, and 75\\% of students recommended continuing it. Finally, we provide a road-map for adapting peer review to other visualization courses to produce more highly engaged students.", "keywords": "Human-centered computing-; Visualization theory, concepts and paradigms; Human-centered computing; Visualization; Visualization design and evaluation methods", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.1261", "refList": ["10.1109/mcg.2012.55", "10.1016/j.learninstruc.2009.08.007", "10.1111/j.1467-8535.2009.00968.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346331", "10.1177/1473871613481693", "10.1152/advan.00053.2006", "10.1109/te.2008.2010994", "10.1080/02602938.2011.576309", "10.1016/j.edurev.2013.01.002", "10.1016/s0167-7799(02)01985-6", "10.1287/inte.25.4.114", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500131", "10.1080/03075070600680836", "10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599338", "10.1145/2858036.2858280", "10.1109/vast.2009.5333245", "10.1007/978-3-642-21551-3\\_13", "10.1080/02602938.2012.751963", "10.1007/978-3-540-70956-5\\_4", "10.1080/16864360.2017.1397893", "10.1002/j.2168-9830.2000.tb00529.x", "10.1080/02602930500262346", "10.1177/1473871613490290", "10.1177/1473871614550537", "10.1109/icse.2013.6606617", "10.1016/j.learninstruc.2009.08.004", "10.1080/13614576.2011.566812", "10.1109/mcg.2013.57", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1145/872757.872770"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 51}, "index": 630, "embedding": [-1.0586342811584473, 2.2297067642211914, -1.0404996871948242, -2.2971394062042236, -0.6897369623184204, 0.16650904715061188, 1.1518149375915527, 1.0341013669967651, -0.46884602308273315, 2.1801788806915283, -1.719821572303772, 0.25097140669822693, -0.1686236411333084, 1.4226388931274414, 4.6305766105651855, 3.615227460861206, 0.09398351609706879, 5.239015579223633, -0.7571966052055359, 0.846307635307312, -0.06630208343267441, 3.3923373222351074, 1.7984052896499634, 3.133479118347168, -2.3829734325408936, 3.6312153339385986, -0.5834015607833862, 2.647993564605713, 1.4354329109191895, 0.8256660103797913, 0.5972012281417847, 2.810818910598755], "projection": [-0.467235267162323, 10.762979507446289], "size": 26, "height": 4, "width": 15}
