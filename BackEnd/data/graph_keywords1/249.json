But in a highly immersive virtual environment, traditional single-channel precise interactive methods cannot be applied directly to the immersive environment. Inspired by how users typically interact with everyday objects, a novel non-contact gesture interaction method base on What You See is What You Get( WYSIWYG) for volume rendering results is proposed in this paper. Just likes grab interaction in real scene, a full set of tools have been developed to enable direct volume rendering manipulation of color, saturation, contrast, brightness, and other optical properties by gestural motions in our method. Simultaneously, in order to improve the interactive experience in immersive environment, the evaluation model of motion comfort is introduced to design the interactive hand gestures, the cursor model is defined to estimating the gesture state combined with context gestural motions. Finally, the test platform is established with Oculus Rift + Leap Motion to verify the functionality and effectiveness of our method in improving the visual cognitive ability for volume visualization.", "keywords": "WYSIWYG; immersive volume visualization; non-contact gesture interaction; Oculus Rift plus Leap Motion", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.1001", "refList": ["10.1126/science.1167311", "10.1109/ldav.2013.6675159", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.261", "10.1007/978-3-319-39907-2\\_20", "10.1145/3126594.3126613", "10.1016/j.protcy.2015.07.025", "10.1177/1473871611413180", "10.1145/1983302.1983303", "10.1145/2207676.2208585", "10.1007/978-3-319-20889-3\\_63", "10.1080/00207543.2015.1057298", "10.1145/2557500.2557541"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 249, "embedding": [-0.4992811381816864, 0.3832840025424957, -0.5533336997032166, -1.901007056236267, -0.6897369623184204, 0.16650904715061188, -0.664513111114502, -0.3835066854953766, -0.29692184925079346, -0.9566591382026672, 0.6784189939498901, -1.390728235244751, -0.1686236411333084, -0.7703056335449219, 0.05505193769931793, 0.5469805598258972, -0.10638631880283356, 0.06877747178077698, -0.045388709753751755, 0.8672071099281311, -0.06630208343267441, -0.407069593667984, -0.15932048857212067, -0.1691095381975174, -2.3829734325408936, 0.04334019869565964, -0.5834015607833862, 0.41966715455055237, -0.22350378334522247, 0.06499852240085602, -0.2755919396877289, 0.09962540119886398], "projection": [2.30312180519104, 3.7864830493927], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
