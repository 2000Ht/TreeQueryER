To facilitate the creation of affect-stirring infographics, it is important to characterize and understand people's affective responses to infographics and derive practical design guidelines for designers. To address these research questions, we first conducted two crowdsourcing studies to identify 12 infographic-associated affective responses and collect user feedback explaining what triggered affective responses in infographics. Then, by coding the user feedback, we present a taxonomy of design heuristics that exemplifies the affect-related design factors in infographics. We evaluated the design heuristics with 15 designers. The results showed that our work supports assessing the affective design in infographics and facilitates the ideation and creation of affective infographics.", "doi": "smileorscowllookinga-2021", "year": 2021, "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "citationCount": 0, "keywords": "", "link": "", "refList": "", "wos": 0, "len": 1}, "index": 1632, "embedding": [-1.9854819774627686, -0.2614552974700928, -1.03950035572052, -0.22114413976669312, -0.11444863677024841, 0.16650904715061188, 5.706880569458008, 1.7009357213974, 7.18064022064209, -0.6802392601966858, 2.425419807434082, -0.8929865956306458, 0.05484810844063759, 2.1093215942382812, -0.7128351926803589, -0.5202935338020325, 0.012518618255853653, 0.06584581732749939, -0.17983613908290863, 0.03868870064616203, -0.06630208343267441, 0.4564744532108307, -0.13968026638031006, -0.12045589834451675, -1.1831179857254028, 2.221646785736084, -0.4969606399536133, -0.16244997084140778, -0.5392300486564636, -2.6684696674346924, 0.2814798355102539, -0.8738863468170166], "projection": [14.635682106018066, 4.323057651519775], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
