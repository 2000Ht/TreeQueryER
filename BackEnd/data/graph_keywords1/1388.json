In this application paper, we present a graph comparison method using radial graphs that show Areas of Interest (AOIs) and their transitions. An analyst investigates a single graph based on dwell times, directed transitions, and temporal AOI sequences. Two graphs can be compared directly and temporal changes may be analyzed. A list and matrix approach facilitate the analyst to contrast more than two graphs guided by visually encoded graph similarities. We evaluated our approach in case studies with three eye tracking and visualization experts. They identified temporal transition patterns of eye movements across participants, groups of participants, and outliers.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13170", "refList": ["10.1145/2857491.2857524", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.117", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2468111", "10.1111/cgf.12791", "10.1109/iv.2011.49", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.276", "10.1109/infvis.2001.963281", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01898.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.263", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.181", "10.1080/13875868.2016.1226839", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467871", "10.1109/vissoft.2013.6650549", "10.1145/2578153.2578175", "10.1109/iv.2009.108", "10.1177/1473871612455983", "10.1145/1743666.1743721", "10.1109/vast.2016.7883520", "10.1007/978-3-319-47024-5\\_7", "10.1016/b978-044451020-4/50035-9", "10.1109/iv.2016.28", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346677", "10.1145/2470654.2470724", "10.1016/s0169-8141(98)00068-7", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70521", "10.1111/cgf.12115", "10.1145/2509315.2509326", "10.1109/pacificvis.2016.7465266", "10.1145/2669557.2669558", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.149", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.150", "10.1179/000870403235002042"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00037", "year": "2019", "title": "A Visual Approach for the Comparative Analysis of Character Networks in Narrative Texts", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Markus John;Martin Baumann", "citationCount": "1", "affiliation": "John, M (Corresponding Author), Univ Stuttgart, Inst Visualizat \\& Interact Syst VIS, Stuttgart, Germany.\nJohn, Markus; Baumann, Martin; Schuetz, David; Koch, Steffen; Ertl, Thomas, Univ Stuttgart, Inst Visualizat \\& Interact Syst VIS, Stuttgart, Germany.", "countries": "Germany", "abstract": "The analysis of a novel's plot and characters are challenging and time-consuming tasks in literary criticism. Typically, humanities scholars want to describe and compare characters' personality traits, their roles, their relationships, and the evolution of these aspects over the course of a novel. Nowadays, due to the digitization of literature, humanities scholars can be supported in these endeavors with computational methods. In this paper, we present an approach that offers several means to analyze the plot and characters of a novel visually. Analysts can easily switch between an adjacency matrix and a node-link representation, which provide an overview of the characters and the relationships between them. Both views enable analysts to select different text ranges of the novel for studying the commonalities and differences of the character constellations within these ranges. We offer interactive visual representations to help investigate the relationships between the characters in more detail. Additionally, we link the visual representations with the novels' texts to support the inspection and verification of previously generated ideas and hypotheses. To demonstrate the benefits and limitations of our approach, we present two usage scenarios. The first one is based on a fictitious analysis and the second one discusses applications that were carried out during joint workshops with humanities scholars. Finally, we present and discuss the insights gained by an expert study and the design decisions of our approach.", "keywords": "Visual text analysis; document analysis; close reading; distant reading; digital humanities; graph comparison", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis.2019.00037", "refList": ["10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1145/2702123.2702476", "10.1111/cgf.13181", "10.1111/cgf.12791", "10.1111/cgf.13170", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01898.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1109/vast.2009.5333248", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467971", "10.1080/10447318.2010.516722", "10.1136/qshc.2004.010033", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.169", "10.3115/v1/p14-5010", "10.1109/tmm.2016.2614184", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.106", "10.1111/cgf.12124", "10.1109/iv.2016.28", "10.1145/2470654.2470724", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500180", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742388", "10.2190/ec.44.1.a", "10.13140/2.1.1341.1520", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.232", "10.1109/vast.2007.4389004", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500092", "10.1007/978-0-85729-079-3"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1388, "embedding": [-0.21932899951934814, -0.05394425988197327, 0.8311657905578613, 1.494241714477539, -0.6495316028594971, 0.16650904715061188, -0.7182635068893433, -0.7486607432365417, -0.4013857841491699, -0.8018340468406677, -0.1794261485338211, -0.46493300795555115, -0.1336275339126587, 0.5751866698265076, -0.18330775201320648, 0.13432995975017548, -0.19392754137516022, 0.07991757988929749, -0.3898025453090668, 1.4697178602218628, -0.06630208343267441, -0.16970294713974, 0.18862760066986084, -0.13207590579986572, 0.3237590193748474, 0.09441477060317993, -0.5399249196052551, -0.17674389481544495, 0.2307124137878418, -0.10795267671346664, -0.05346310883760452, 0.17236194014549255], "projection": [-3.068385362625122, 6.02327299118042], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
