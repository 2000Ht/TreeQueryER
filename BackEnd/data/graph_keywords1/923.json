They come from various domains and often need to explore diverse sets of hypotheses and theories, a variety of data sources, algorithms, methods, tools, and visual designs. Taken together, we call these alternatives. To better understand and characterize the role of alternatives in their analyses, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 data workers with different types of expertise. We conducted four types of analyses to understand 1) why data workers explore alternatives; 2) the different notions of alternatives and how they fit into the sensemaking process; 3) the high-level processes around alternatives; and 4) their strategies to generate, explore, and manage those alternatives. We find that participants' diverse levels of domain and computational expertise, experience with different tools, and collaboration within their broader context play an important role in how they explore these alternatives. These findings call out the need for more attention towards a deeper understanding of alternatives and the need for better tools to facilitate the exploration, interpretation, and management of alternatives. Drawing upon these analyses and findings, we present a framework based on participants' 1) degree of attention, 2) abstraction level, and 3) analytic processes. We show how this framework can help understand how data workers consider such alternatives in their analyses and how tool designers might create tools to better support them.", "keywords": "alternatives,data workers,data analysis,data science,sensemaking,qualitative study", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934593", "refList": ["10.1109/hicss.1988.11929", "10.1109/vlhcc.2014.6883030", "10.1109/ms.2009.193", "10.1145/3173574.3173606", "10.1111/cgf.12106", "10.1145/1124772", "10.1145/1124772.1124960", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.219", "10.1117/12.378894", "10.2307/1954355", "10.1145/985692.985782", "10.1145/2598784.2602788", "10.1145/1866029.1866038", "10.1145/1449715.1449732", "10.4324/9780203810088", "10.1145/3025453.3025626", "10.1109/vlhcc.2016.7739680", "10.1145/581710.581718", "10.1145/3025453.3025738", "10.1109/vlhcc.2017.8103446", "10.1145/3290605.3300874", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864836", "10.1145/1314683.1314685", "10.1145/3290605.3300432"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030462", "title": "Table Scraps: An Actionable Framework for Multi-Table Data Wrangling From An Artifact Study of Computational Journalism", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Stephen Kasica;Charles Berret;Tamara Munzner", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Kasica, S (Corresponding Author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Comp Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

Despite an abundance of literature on data wrangling in the context of enterprise data analysis, little is known about the specific operations, processes, and pain points journalists encounter while performing this tedious, time-consuming task. To better understand the needs of this user group, we conduct a technical observation study of 50 public repositories of data and analysis code authored by 33 professional journalists at 26 news organizations. We develop two detailed and cross-cutting taxonomies of data wrangling in computational journalism, for actions and for processes. We observe the extensive use of multiple tables, a notable gap in previous wrangling analyses. We develop a concise, actionable framework for general multi-table data wrangling that includes wrangling operations documented in our taxonomy that are without clear parallels in other work. This framework, the first to incorporate tables as first-class objects, will support future interactive wrangling tools for both computational journalism and general-purpose use. We assess the generative and descriptive power of our framework through discussion of its relationship to our set of taxonomies.", "keywords": "Computational journalism,Data journalism,Data wrangling", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030462", "refList": ["10.1145/1378773.1378792", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.219", "10.1109/vast47406.2019.8986909", "10.1145/1084805.1084812", "10.1007/s00778-008-0098-x", "10.1016/j.websem.2008.09.005", "10.18637/jss.v040.i01", "10.1145/989863.989865", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467551", "10.5281/zenodo.3509134", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934593", "10.1109/tse.2018.2796554", "10.17349/jmc117309", "10.1109/2945.981851", "10.1109/vast.2011.6102440", "10.1177/1473871611415994", "10.1145/2001269.2001288"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 923, "embedding": [0.2904266119003296, 0.9850260019302368, 0.5871705412864685, 1.177513599395752, -0.6721880435943604, 0.16650904715061188, -0.4858611822128296, 1.8806941509246826, -0.45468848943710327, -0.8709165453910828, 0.11191483587026596, 1.0651593208312988, -0.15996834635734558, 2.3583712577819824, 1.2829835414886475, 0.8644259572029114, 0.026173757389187813, 0.05552856996655464, -0.7097932696342468, -1.063811182975769, -0.06630208343267441, 1.7093924283981323, 0.331444650888443, -0.1577943116426468, 0.8644625544548035, 0.061810001730918884, -0.5581337213516235, 0.5229307413101196, 1.9865280389785767, -1.2106382846832275, 0.4573254883289337, 1.1287002563476562], "projection": [-4.558279037475586, 7.55892276763916], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
