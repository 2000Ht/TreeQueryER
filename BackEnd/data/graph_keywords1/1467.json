We compare: (a) a 3D exocentric globe, where the user's viewpoint is outside the globe; (b) a flat map (rendered to a plane in VR); (c) an egocentric 3D globe, with the viewpoint inside the globe; and (d) a curved map, created by projecting the map onto a section of a sphere which curves around the user. In all four visualisations the geographic centre can be smoothly adjusted with a standard handheld VR controller and the user, through a head-tracked headset, can physically move around the visualisation. For distance comparison exocentric globe is more accurate than egocentric globe and flat map. For area comparison more time is required with exocentric and egocentric globes than with flat and curved maps. For direction estimation, the exocentric globe is more accurate and faster than the other visual presentations. Our study participants had a weak preference for the exocentric globe. Generally the curved map had benefits over the flat map. In almost all cases the egocentric globe was found to be the least effective visualisation. Overall, our results provide support for the use of exocentric globes for geographic visualisation in mixed-reality.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13431", "refList": ["10.1037/0096-3445.129.2.193", "10.1016/s0377-2217(03)00037-7", "10.1073/pnas.0407994102", "10.1016/j.cognition.2010.03.009", "10.1553/giscience2016\\_01\\_s314", "10.1037/0278-7393.32.3.333", "10.1080/00045608.2015.1022091", "10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2015.05.001", "10.1007/978-3-319-51835-0\\_9", "10.2307/1420573", "10.1098/rsif.2009.0495", "10.1179/0008704113z.00000000078", "10.1145/159544.159587", "10.1145/3013971.3013983", "10.1007/978-3-642-80328-4\\_13", "10.1029/2002jd003179", "10.1145/2702123.2702172", "10.1038/nature10082", "10.1080/00087041.2015.1131938", "10.1126/science.1244693", "10.1109/bdva.2015.7314302", "10.2307/1421904", "10.1080/17538947.2014.1002867", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2520921", "10.1109/3dvis.2014.7160094", "10.1080/00045600802683734", "10.1093/oxfordjournals.epirev.a017993", "10.2307/622344"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865192", "title": "Origin-Destination Flow Maps in Immersive Environments", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Yalong Yang;Tim Dwyer;Bernhard Jenny;Kim Marriott;Maxime Cordeil;Haohui Chen", "citationCount": "5", "affiliation": "Yang, YL (Corresponding Author), Monash Univ, Clayton, Vic, Australia.

The technology is rapidly improving and may, in the long term, replace traditional flat panel displays in many situations. When displays are no longer intrinsically flat, how should we use the space around the user for abstract data visualisation? In this paper, we ask this question with respect to origin-destination flow data in a global geographic context. We report on the findings of three studies exploring different spatial encodings for flow maps. The first experiment focuses on different 2D and 3D encodings for flows on flat maps. We find that participants are significantly more accurate with raised flow paths whose height is proportional to flow distance but fastest with traditional straight line 2D flows. In our second and third experiment we compared flat maps, 3D globes and a novel interactive design we call<i>MapsLink</i>, involving a pair of linked flat maps. We find that participants took significantly more time with MapsLink than other flow maps while the 3D globe with raised flows was the fastest, most accurate, and most preferred method.

Even though large displays provide more display space, they are challenging with regard to perception, effective multi-user support, and managing data density and complexity. To address these issues and illustrate our proposed setup, we contribute an extensive design space comprising first, the spatial alignment of display, visualizations, and objects in AR space. Next, we discuss which parts of a visualization can be augmented. Finally, we analyze how AR can be used to display personal views in order to show additional information and to minimize the mutual disturbance of data analysts. Based on this conceptual foundation, we present a number of exemplary techniques for extending visualizations with AR and discuss their relation to our design space. We further describe how these techniques address typical visualization problems that we have identified during our literature research. To examine our concepts, we introduce a generic AR visualization framework as well as a prototype implementing several example techniques. In order to demonstrate their potential, we further present a use case walkthrough in which we analyze a movie data set. From these experiences, we conclude that the contributed techniques can be useful in exploring and understanding multivariate data.

Trajectories in sports, such as the movement of players and balls, contain rich information on player behavior and thus have been widely analyzed by coaches and analysts to improve the players' performance. However, existing visual analytics systems often present the trajectories in court diagrams that are abstractions of reality, thereby causing difficulty for the experts to imagine the situation on the court and understand why the player acted in a certain way. With recent developments in immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), experts gradually have the opportunity to see, feel, explore, and understand these 3D trajectories from the player's perspective. Yet, few research has studied how to support immersive analysis of sports data from such a perspective. Specific challenges are rooted in data presentation (e.g., how to seamlessly combine 2D and 3D visualizations) and interaction (e.g., how to naturally interact with data without keyboard and mouse) in VR. To address these challenges, we have worked closely with domain experts who have worked for a top national badminton team to design ShuttleSpace.

These processes are typically imagined as formalised, extended activities, between groups of dedicated experts, requiring expertise with sophisticated data analysis tools. However, there are many professional domains that benefit from support for short 'bursts' of data exploration between a subset of stakeholders with a diverse breadth of knowledge. Such 'casual collaborative\u2019 scenarios will require engaging features to draw users' attention, with intuitive, 'walk-up and use\u2019 interfaces. This paper presents Uplift, a novel prototype system to support 'casual collaborative visual analytics' for a campus microgrid, co-designed with local stakeholders. An elicitation workshop with key members of the building management team revealed relevant knowledge is distributed among multiple experts in their team, each using bespoke analysis tools. Uplift combines an engaging 3D model on a central tabletop display with intuitive tangible interaction, as well as augmented-reality, mid-air data visualisation, in order to support casual collaborative visual analytics for this complex domain. Evaluations with expert stakeholders from the building management and energy domains were conducted during and following our prototype development and indicate that Uplift is successful as an engaging backdrop for casual collaboration. Experts see high potential in such a system to bring together diverse knowledge holders and reveal complex interactions between structural, operational, and financial aspects of their domain. Such systems have further potential in other domains that require collaborative discussion or demonstration of models, forecasts, or cost-benefit analyses to high-level stakeholders.", "keywords": "Data visualisation,tangible and embedded interaction,augmented reality,immersive analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030334", "refList": ["10.1109/vr.2019.8797733", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865235", "10.1111/cgf.13213", "10.1109/mcg.2014.82", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.153", "10.1145/1240624.1240701", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.166", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1145/3343055.3359718", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00010", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.275", "10.1109/vr46266.2020.00-20", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.287", "10.3788/co.20201301.0001", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934803", "10.1145/3173574.3173610", "10.1145/2858036.2858524", "10.1145/3359996.3364242", "10.1145/3173574.3173593", "10.1177/1473871611412817", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745958", "10.1111/cgf.12871", "10.1145/2817721.2817735", "10.1145/2317956.2318025", "10.1145/1166253.1166280", "10.1007/978-3-319-73207-7", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934415", "10.1109/cmv.2007.20", "10.1109/vr46266.2020.1582298687237", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.162", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933673", "10.1109/mcg.2019.2897927", "10.1145/2702123.2702331", "10.1145/2576099", "10.1145/3290605.3300288", "10.1145/3173574.3173664", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532136", "10.1109/3dui.2014.6798842", "10.1145/302979.303113", "10.1145/3343055.3359709", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598608", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744199", "10.1145/1936652.1936676", "10.1117/12.2521648", "10.1080/15384047.2020.1806642", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.197", "10.1145/3009939.3009945", "10.1145/3126594.3126613", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2592906", "10.1109/mcg.2019.2898856", "10.1111/cgf.13206", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.163", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2640960", "10.1145/3173574.3173759", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744184", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745258", "10.1023/a:1021271517844", "10.1145/2817721.2817726", "10.1145/2858036.2858158", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865192", "10.1109/bigdata.2018.8622521", "10.1145/642611.642695", "10.1145/2785830.2785871", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.204", "10.1080/07370024.2019.1697697", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2903956", "10.1109/tcyb.2020.2970556", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.251", "10.1145/2702123.2702312", "10.1177/1473871611415997", "10.1145/2817721.2823505", "10.1145/3290605.3300521", "10.2312/eurp", "10.1145/2470654.2466431"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00022", "year": "2019", "title": "What-Why Analysis of Expert Interviews: Analysing Geographically-Embedded Flow Data", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Yalong Yang;Sarah Goodwin", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Yang, YL (Corresponding Author), Monash Univ, Caulfield Sch Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic, Australia.\nYang, Yalong; Goodwin, Sarah, Monash Univ, Caulfield Sch Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic, Australia.", "countries": "Australia", "abstract": "In this paper, we present our analysis of five expert interviews, each from a different application domain.

We replicate hand-drawn relief shading using U-Net neural networks. The deep neural networks are trained with manual shaded relief images of the Swiss topographic map series and terrain models of the same area. The networks generate shaded relief that closely resemble hand-drawn shaded relief art. The networks learn essential design principles from manual relief shading such as removing unnecessary terrain details, locally adjusting the illumination direction to accentuate individual terrain features, and varying brightness to emphasise larger landforms.
