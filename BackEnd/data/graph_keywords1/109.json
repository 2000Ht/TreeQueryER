Proposed is a high-dimensional rotation technique called AGI3D, combined with an ability to filter elements based on social centrality values. AGI3D is targeted for a high-dimensional embedding of a social graph and its projection onto 3D space. It allows the user to rotate the social graph layout in the high-dimensional space by mouse dragging of a vertex. Its high-dimensional rotation effects give the user an illusion that he/she is destructively reshaping the social graph layout but in reality, it assists the user to find a preferred positioning and direction in the high dimensional space to look at the internal structure of the social graph layout, keeping it unmodified. A prototype implementation of the proposal called Social Viewpoint Finder is tested with about 70 social graphs and this paper reports four of the analysis results.", "keywords": "Social graph visualization; Visual analytics; Multi-dimensional scaling; Interactive graph visualization", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2015.7156391", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2006.120", "10.1088/1742-5468/2008/10/p10008", "10.1007/bf01589116", "10.1145/1989323.1989399", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.238", "10.1016/0047-2484(92)90081-j", "10.1109/iv.2008.10", "10.1016/j.future.2013.04.001", "10.1145/2470654.2466444", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01898.x", "10.1007/978-3-642-36763-2\\_6", "10.1007/978-3-662-45803-7\\_9", "10.1145/1134271.1134277", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249011"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13196", "year": "2017", "title": "Adaptable Radial Axes Plots for Improved Multivariate Data Visualization", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Manuel Rubio{-}S{\\'{a}}nchez;Alberto S{\\'{a}}nchez;D.

Well-known methods include star coordinates or principal component biplots, which represent data attributes as vectors that define axes, and produce linear dimensionality reduction mappings. In this paper we propose a hybrid approach that bridges the gap between star coordinates and principal component biplots, which we denominate adaptable radial axes plots. It is based on solving convex optimization problems where users can: (a) update the axis vectors interactively, as in star coordinates, while producing mappings that enable to estimate attribute values optimally through labeled axes, similarly to principal component biplots; (b) use different norms in order to explore additional nonlinear mappings of the data; and (c) include weights and constraints in the optimization problems for sorting the data along one axis. The result is a flexible technique that complements, extends, and enhances current radial methods for data analysis.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13196", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2013.182", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01958.x", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500099", "10.2307/2334381", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346258", "10.1007/s00357-016-9213-7", "10.1109/pacificvis.2015.7156391", "10.1145/22949.22950", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467324", "10.1111/cgf.12641", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532136", "10.1109/pacificvis.2014.58", "10.2307/2288400", "10.1145/1400214.1400234", "10.1007/978-1-84800-155-8\\_7", "10.1111/cgf.12116", "10.1145/1054972.1055031", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.23", "10.1007/bf02288367", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.209"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865118", "title": "Shape-preserving Star Coordinates", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Vladimir Molchanov;Lars Linsen", "citationCount": "1", "affiliation": "Molchanov, V (Corresponding Author), Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Munster, Germany.

In visual analysis systems, projections embed multidimensional data into 2D or 3D spaces for graphical representation. To facilitate a robust and accurate analysis, essential characteristics of the multidimensional data shall be preserved when projecting. Orthographic star coordinates is a state-of-the-art linear projection method that avoids distortion of multidimensional clusters by restricting interactive exploration to orthographic projections. However, existing numerical methods for computing orthographic star coordinates have a number of limitations when putting them into practice. We overcome these limitations by proposing the novel concept of shape-preserving star coordinates where shape preservation is assured using a superset of orthographic projections. Our scheme is explicit, exact, simple, fast, parameter-free, and stable. To maintain a valid shape-preserving star-coordinates configuration during user interaction with one of the star-coordinates axes, we derive an algorithm that only requires us to modify the configuration of one additional compensatory axis. Different design goals can be targeted by using different strategies for selecting the compensatory axis. We propose and discuss four strategies including a strategy that approximates orthographic star coordinates very well and a data-driven strategy. We further present shape-preserving morphing strategies between two shape-preserving configurations, which can be adapted for the generation of data tours. We apply our concept to multiple data analysis scenarios to document its applicability and validate its desired properties.", "keywords": "Star coordinates,multidimensional data projection,multivariate data visualization", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865118", "refList": ["10.1007/978-1-4612-4214", "10.2312/eurovisshort.20141152", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.182", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500099", "10.2307/2334381", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346258", "10.1016/j.cag.2016.08.007", "10.1111/cgf.13196", "10.1080/10618600.1995.10474674", "10.1111/cgf.12117", "10.1137/0906011", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467324", "10.3390/pr5040075", "10.2307/2289161", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467132", "10.1109/t-c.1974.224051", "10.1177/1473871612439357", "10.2312/vcbm.20151204", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.209"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.8199", "year": "2020", "title": "Efficient Morphing of Shape-preserving Star Coordinates", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Vladimir Molchanov;Sagad Hamid;Lars Linsen", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Molchanov, V (Corresponding Author), Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Munster, Germany.\nMolchanov, Vladimir; Hamid, Sagad; Linsen, Lars, Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Munster, Germany.", "countries": "Germany", "abstract": "Data tours follow an exploratory multi-dimensional data visualization concept that provides animations of projections of the multidimensional data to a 2D visual space. To create an animation, a sequence of key projections is provided and morphings between each pair of consecutive key projections are computed, which then can be stitched together to form the data tour. The morphings should be smooth so that a user can easily follow the transformations, and their computations shall be fast to allow for their integration into an interactive visual exploration process. Moreover, if the key projections are chosen to satisfy additional conditions, it is desirable that these conditions are maintained during morphing. Shape preservation is such a desirable condition, as it avoids shape distortions that may otherwise be caused by a projection. We develop a novel efficient morphing algorithms for computing shape-preserving data tours, i.e., data tours constructed for a sequence of shape-preserving linear projections. We propose a stepping strategy for the morphing to avoid discontinuities in the evolution of the projections, where we represent the linear projections using a star-coordinates system.
