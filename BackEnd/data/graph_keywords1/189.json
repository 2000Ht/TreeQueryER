The challenge for the proxy graph approach is to ensure that the proxy graph is a good representation of the original graph. However, previous work to compute proxy graphs using graph sampling techniques often fails to preserve connectivity and important global skeletal structure in the original graph. This paper introduces two new families of proxy graph methods BCP-W and BCP-E, tightly integrating graph sampling methods with the BC (Block Cut-vertex) tree, which represents the decomposition of a graph into biconnected components. Experimental results using graph sampling quality metrics show that our new BC tree-based proxy graph methods produce significantly better results than existing sampling-based proxy graph methods: 25\\% improvement by BCP-W and 15\\% by BCP-E on average. We also present DBCP, a BC tree-based proxy graph method for distributed environment. Experiments on the Amazon Cloud EC2 demonstrate that DBCP is scalable for big graph data sets; runtime speed-up of 77\\% for distributed 5-server on average. Visual comparison using a graph layout method and the proxy quality metrics confirm that our new BC tree-based proxy graph methods are significantly better than existing sampling-based proxy graph method. Our main results lead to guidelines for computing sampling-based proxy graphs for visualization of big graphs.", "keywords": "Human-centered computing; Visualization; Visualization techniques", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis.2018.00011", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598867", "10.1016/0378-8733(78)90021-7", "10.1103/physreve.73.016102", "10.1103/physreve.67.026126", "10.1145/1150402.1150479", "10.1103/physreve.75.027105", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2674999", "10.1109/pacificvis.2013.6596147", "10.1073/pnas.0400087101", "10.7155/jgaa.00405", "10.1145/362248.362272", "10.1371/journal.pone.0085777"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.14003", "year": "2020", "title": "Sublinear Time Force Computation for Big Complex Network Visualization", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Amyra Meidiana;Seok{-}Hee Hong;Marnijati Torkel;Shijun Cai;Peter Eades", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Meidiana, A (Corresponding Author), Univ Sydney, Sch Comp Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.\nMeidiana, Amyra; Hong, Seok-Hee; Torkel, Marnijati; Cai, Shijun; Eades, Peter, Univ Sydney, Sch Comp Sci, Sydney, NSW, Australia.", "countries": "Australia", "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new framework for sublinear time force computation for visualization of big complex graphs. Our algorithm is based on the sampling of vertices for computing repulsion forces and edge sparsification for attraction force computation. More specifically, for vertex sampling, we present three types of sampling algorithms, including random sampling, geometric sampling, and combinatorial sampling, to reduce the repulsion force computation to sublinear in the number of vertices. We utilize a spectral sparsification approach to reduce the number of attraction force computations to sublinear in the number of edges for dense graphs. We also present a smart initialization method based on radial tree drawing of the BFS spanning tree rooted at the center. Experiments show that our new sublinear time force computation algorithms run quite fast, while producing good visualization of large and complex networks, with significant improvements in quality metrics such as shape-based and edge crossing metrics.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14003", "refList": ["10.1038/324446a0", "10.1142/9789812773296\\_0012", "10.1002/spe.4380211102", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00011", "10.1137/08074489x", "10.7155/jgaa.00405", "10.1007/978-3-642-18469-7\\_8", "10.1007/978-981-10-1503-8\\_1", "10.1007/978-1-4614-7163-9\\textbackslash{}\\_315-1", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1109/dsaa.2017.15"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 189, "embedding": [0.07070837914943695, -0.04612051695585251, -1.0741424560546875, -0.11824924498796463, 0.18919168412685394, 0.16650904715061188, -0.6826844215393066, 0.9937918782234192, 0.8440108299255371, 0.4407788813114166, 0.23804409801959991, -0.20301783084869385, -0.04616205021739006, -1.0822652578353882, -0.7502163648605347, -0.45156827569007874, 0.3592613637447357, 0.06402745097875595, -0.6852008700370789, 0.25933727622032166, -0.06630208343267441, -0.33904245495796204, -1.0116956233978271, 0.17931410670280457, -1.2387213706970215, 0.09350619465112686, -0.5670700073242188, -0.18801918625831604, 0.69619220495224, -1.6241027116775513, -0.41281992197036743, -0.46252667903900146], "projection": [-1.754021167755127, 8.618549346923828], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
