Examining the notions of scalability and elasticity in interactive visualizations, we introduce a visualization of personal reading traces such as marginalia or markings inside the reference library of German realist author Theodor Fontane. To explore such a rich and extensive collection, meaningful visual forms of abstraction and detail are as important as the transitions between those states. Following a growing research interest in the role of fluid interactivity and animations between views, we are particularly interested in the potential of carefully designed transitions and consistent representations across scales. The resulting prototype addresses humanistic research questions about the interplay of distant and close reading with visualization research on continuous navigation along several granularity levels, using scrolling as one of the main interaction mechanisms. In addition to presenting the design process and resulting prototype, we present findings from a qualitative evaluation of the tool, which suggest that bridging between distant and close views can enhance exploration, but that transitions between views need to be crafted very carefully to facilitate comprehension.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13964", "refList": ["10.1007/s41244-017-0048-4", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.108", "10.1145/1456650.1456652", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346424", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1111/cgf.13195", "10.1145/2207676.2208607", "10.1145/1376616.1376618", "10.1006/ijhc.2002.1017", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1177/1473871611413180", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1006/ijhc.1017", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2830759", "10.1145/1556262.1556300", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346677", "10.1145/2909132.2909255", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70539", "10.1145/2396636.2396675", "10.1145/1978942.1979124", "10.1016/j.ijhcs.2003.08.005", "10.2312/eurovisstar.20151113", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532127"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1554, "embedding": [-1.9954558610916138, -0.2517378628253937, -1.060706377029419, -0.32634517550468445, -0.17045269906520844, 0.16650904715061188, 5.380379676818848, 1.5225602388381958, 6.754868507385254, -0.5890102982521057, 2.0914499759674072, -0.920688271522522, 0.1905195266008377, 2.199202299118042, -0.678647518157959, -0.5592858791351318, -0.05316852033138275, 0.08175134658813477, -0.2071121335029602, 0.36516061425209045, -0.06630208343267441, 0.5449568629264832, -0.15046541392803192, -0.12925946712493896, -1.3074088096618652, 2.6810619831085205, -0.5500518083572388, -0.16255053877830505, -0.5349987745285034, -2.490147590637207, 0.27202510833740234, -0.905439555644989], "projection": [17.75169563293457, 3.4916927814483643], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
