In real-time explorative visualization it is common to render the resulting data using opaque spherical glyphs with local lighting only. Due to massive overlaps, however, inner structures of the data are often occluded rendering visual analysis impossible. Furthermore, local lighting is not sufficient as several important features like complex shapes, holes, rifts or filaments cannot be perceived well. To address both problems we present a new technique that jointly supports transparency and ambient occlusion in a consistent illumination model. Our approach is based on the emission-absorption model of volume rendering. We provide analytic solutions to the volume rendering integral for several density distributions within a spherical glyph. Compared to constant transparency our approach preserves the three-dimensional impression of the glyphs much better. We approximate ambient illumination with a fast hierarchical voxel cone-tracing approach, which builds on a new real-time voxelization of the particle data. Our implementation achieves interactive frame rates for millions of static or dynamic particles without any preprocessing. We illustrate the merits of our method on real-world data sets gaining several new insights.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12627", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2011.161", "10.1093/bioinformatics/bti818", "10.1016/0263-7855(96)00018-5", "10.1145/1281500.1281671", "10.1145/2461912.2461930", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.142", "10.1007/s00371-014-0956-z", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01698.x", "10.1109/2945.597794", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.115", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.45", "10.1111/cgf.12252", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.25", "10.1111/cgf.12197", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.159", "10.1109/tvcg.2004.1260759", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183593", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03128.x"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030470", "title": "Ray Tracing Structured AMR Data Using ExaBricks", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Ingo Wald;Stefan Zellmann;William Usher;Nathan Morrical;Ulrich Lang;Valerio Pascucci", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Wald, I (Corresponding Author), NVIDIA, Santa Clara, CA 95051 USA.

Together, these data structures allow a ray tracing based renderer to quickly determine which segments along the ray need to be integrated and at what frequency, while also providing quick access to all data values required for a smooth sample reconstruction kernel. Our method makes use of the RTX ray tracing hardware for surface rendering, ray marching, space skipping, and adaptive sampling; and allows for interactive changes to the transfer function and implicit iso-surfacing thresholds.

Today, the most frequently used atom-based representations are the Space-filling, the Solvent Excluded Surface, the Balls-and-Sticks, and the Licorice models. While each of these representations has its individual benefits, when applied to large-scale models spatial arrangements can be difficult to interpret when employing current visualization techniques. In the past it has been shown that global illumination techniques improve the perception of molecular visualizations; unfortunately existing approaches are tailored towards a single visual representation. We propose a general illumination model for molecular visualization that is valid for different representations. With our illumination model, it becomes possible, for the first time, to achieve consistent illumination among all atom-based molecular representations. The proposed model can be further evaluated in real-time, as it employs an analytical solution to simulate diffuse light interactions between objects. To be able to derive such a solution for the rather complicated and diverse visual representations, we propose the use of regression analysis together with adapted parameter sampling strategies as well as shape parametrization guided sampling, which are applied to the geometric building blocks of the targeted visual representations. We will discuss the proposed sampling strategies, the derived illumination model, and demonstrate its capabilities when visualizing several dynamic molecules.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13426", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2009.157", "10.1145/2461912.2462009", "10.1111/cgf.12374", "10.2312/spbg/spbg06/059-065", "10.1007/s00371-017-1397-2", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.115", "10.1016/j.cag.2015.07.017", "10.1111/cgf.12627", "10.1002/(sici)1097-0282(199603)38:3", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467293", "10.1016/j.visres.2010.09.006", "10.1111/cgf.12349", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01917.x", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01693.x", "10.1111/cgf.12197", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183593", "10.1109/icra.2015.7139702", "10.1007/978-90-481-2678-1\\_6", "10.1006/jsbi.1996.0022", "10.1109/biovis.2011.6094043", "10.1111/cgf.12370"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934612", "title": "Multi-Scale Procedural Animations of Microtubule Dynamics Based on Measured Data", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Tobias Klein;Ivan Viola;M.

One example for such structures are microtubules, which are present in every eukaryotic cell. They are part of the cytoskeleton maintaining the shape of the cell and playing a key role in the cell division. In this paper, we propose a scientifically-accurate multi-scale procedural model of microtubule dynamics as a novel application scenario for procedural animation, which can generate visualizations of their overall shape, molecular structure, as well as animations of the dynamic behaviour of their growth and disassembly. The model is spanning from tens of micrometers down to atomic resolution. All the aspects of the model are driven by scientific data. The advantage over a traditional, manual animation approach is that when the underlying data change, for instance due to new evidence, the model can be recreated immediately.
