Most of these tools are developed for classical data science applications, where a user is supported in analyzing measured or simulated data. But recently, there has also been an increasing interest in visual support for understanding machine learning algorithms and frameworks, especially for deep learning. Many, if not most, of the visualization support for (deep) learning addresses the developer of the learning system and not the end user (data scientist). Here we show on a specific example, namely the development of a matrix calculus algorithm, that supporting visualizations can also greatly benefit the development of algorithms in classical domains like in our case computer algebra. The idea is similar to visually supporting the understanding of learning algorithms, namely provide the developer with an interactive, visual tool that provides insights into the workings and, importantly, also into the failures of the algorithm under development. Developing visualization support for matrix calculus development went similar as the development of more traditional visual support systems for data analysts. First, we had to acquaint ourselves with the problem, its language and challenges by talking to the core developer of the matrix calculus algorithm. Once we understood the challenge, it was fairly easy to develop visual support that streamlined the development of the matrix calculus algorithm significantly.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13694", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744878", "10.1109/38.124293", "10.1109/38.135916", "10.1007/978-3-642-17286-1", "10.1109/tsmc.1981.4308636", "10.1109/32.221135", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.156", "10.1007/bf01454201", "10.1109/21.108304", "10.2307/2369436", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1103/physreva.60.910", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.67"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1510, "embedding": [-2.1418709754943848, -0.2901577949523926, -1.0366979837417603, -0.36266013979911804, -0.2160092294216156, 0.16650904715061188, 4.429186820983887, 1.5800764560699463, 6.711771011352539, -0.6967183947563171, 2.528451442718506, -1.0838862657546997, 0.005573777016252279, 1.9889839887619019, -0.9044764637947083, -0.5381391644477844, -0.20442822575569153, 0.06749609857797623, -0.3395666182041168, 0.01539750024676323, -0.06630208343267441, 0.5692785978317261, -0.19383466243743896, -0.14990495145320892, -1.151760458946228, 2.681239366531372, -0.561912477016449, -0.2069312334060669, -0.5637652277946472, -2.7424004077911377, 0.15335805714130402, -0.9553877711296082], "projection": [-9.713643074035645, -14.852930068969727], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
