Their backward integration is in practice infeasible, since a slight change in the initial velocity causes extreme changes in the recovered position. Thus, if an inertial particle is observed, it is difficult to recover where it came from. This is known as the source inversion problem, which has many practical applications in recovering the source of airborne or waterborne pollutions. Inertial trajectories live in a higher dimensional spatio-velocity space. In this paper, we show that this space is only sparsely populated. Assuming that inertial particles are released with a given initial velocity (e.g., from rest), particles may reach a certain location only with a limited set of possible velocities. In fact, with increasing integration duration and dependent on the particle response time, inertial particles converge to a terminal velocity. We show that the set of initial positions that lead to the same location form a curve. We extract these curves by devising a derived vector field in which they appear as tangent curves. Most importantly, the derived vector field only involves forward integrated flow map gradients, which are much more stable to compute than backward trajectories. After extraction, we interactively visualize the curves in the domain and display the reached velocities using glyphs. In addition, we encode the rate of change of the terminal velocity along the curves, which gives a notion for the convergence to the terminal velocity. With this, we present the first solution to the source inversion problem that considers actual inertial trajectories. We apply the method to steady and unsteady flows in both 2D and 3D domains.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12913", "refList": ["10.1063/1.2204064", "10.1063/1.3579597", "10.1088/0266-5611/21/3/020", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03063.x", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1175/2007jamc1733.1", "10.1016/s0168-874x(03)00054-4", "10.1016/j.physd.2005.10.007", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1117/12.906872", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.93", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.198", "10.1126/science.1072678", "10.1029/2004wr003754", "10.1103/physreve.84.016406", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1103/physreve.80.066318", "10.1029/ja094ia09p11821"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "title": "Topological Analysis of Inertial Dynamics", "year": "2016", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Antoni Sagrist\u00e0;Stefan Jordan;Andreas Just;Fabio Dias;Luis Gustavo Nonato;Filip Sadlo", "citationCount": "7", "affiliation": "Sagrista, A (Corresponding Author), Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to the analysis of the force-induced dynamics of inertial particles. These forces can arise from acceleration fields such as gravitation, but also be dependent on the particle dynamics itself, as in the case of magnetism. Compared to massless particles, the velocity of an inertial particle is not determined solely by its position and time in a vector field. In contrast, its initial velocity can be arbitrary and impacts the dynamics over its entire lifetime. This leads to a four-dimensional problem for 2D setups, and a six-dimensional problem for the 3D case. Our approach avoids this increase in dimensionality and tackles the visualization by an integrated topological analysis approach.

The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.", "keywords": "Vortex extraction,inertial particles,objectivity,vortex coreline", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828", "refList": ["10.1016/0377-0257(79)87004-4", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1016/0167-2789(91)90088-q", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70633", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_9", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1017/s002211209900467x", "10.1143/jpsj.66.1331", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1017/s0022112092001460", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01238.x", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/visual.1997.663910", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1146/annurev.fluid.23.1.601", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "10.1145/1057432.1057452", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1007/s100219900068", "10.2514/2.744", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1016/0960-0779(94)90137-6", "10.1016/0010-4655(88)90020-3", "10.1109/visual.1991.175773", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1016/j.ijengsci.2007.10.005", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.11", "10.1111/cgf.13439", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1145/2897824.2925919", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0011-7471(70)90059-8", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1053"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13689", "year": "2019", "title": "Robust Reference Frame Extraction from Unsteady 2D Vector Fields with Convolutional Neural Networks", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Byungsoo Kim;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Kim, B (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nKim, Byungsoo; Guenther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Robust feature extraction is an integral part of scientific visualization.

However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.", "keywords": "Deep neural network,3D cerebrovascular segmentation and visualization,maximum intensity projection (MIP),joint embedding", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030374", "refList": ["10.1109/cluster.2018.00036", "10.1109/iccv.2015.123", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.133", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.19", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934312", "10.1007/978-3-319-46487-9\\_40", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.175", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70523", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2880207", "10.1145/3309993", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00018", "10.1109/iccv.2017.244", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.632", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816059", "10.1109/pacificvis.2009.4906852", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864808", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2881523", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467431", "10.1109/tpami.2015.2439281", "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.8737", "10.1109/cvpr.2019.00244", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.165", "10.1109/bigdata.2018.8622520", "10.1007/978-3-319-46466-4\\_29", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933759", "10.1145/3197517.3201304", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742378", "10.1109/cvpr.2006.91", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742369", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934255", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4\\_28", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00041", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934332", "10.1109/cvpr.2018.00916", "10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6\\_43"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}], "len": 7}], "len": 9}, {"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13421", "year": "2018", "title": "Visualization of 4D Vector Field Topology", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Lutz Hofmann;Bastian Rieck;Filip Sadlo", "citationCount": "2", "affiliation": "Hofmann, L (Corresponding Author), Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany.\nHofmann, Lutz; Rieck, Bastian; Sadlo, Filip, Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany.", "countries": "Germany", "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach to the topological analysis of four-dimensional vector fields.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs. Using our method, users gain deeper insights into the dynamics of inertial particles in 2D fluids, including size-dependent separation, preferential clustering and attraction.

The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.", "keywords": "Vortex extraction,inertial particles,objectivity,vortex coreline", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828", "refList": ["10.1016/0377-0257(79)87004-4", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1016/0167-2789(91)90088-q", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70633", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_9", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1017/s002211209900467x", "10.1143/jpsj.66.1331", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1017/s0022112092001460", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01238.x", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/visual.1997.663910", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1146/annurev.fluid.23.1.601", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "10.1145/1057432.1057452", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1007/s100219900068", "10.2514/2.744", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1016/0960-0779(94)90137-6", "10.1016/0010-4655(88)90020-3", "10.1109/visual.1991.175773", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1016/j.ijengsci.2007.10.005", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.11", "10.1111/cgf.13439", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1145/2897824.2925919", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0011-7471(70)90059-8", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1053"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13689", "year": "2019", "title": "Robust Reference Frame Extraction from Unsteady 2D Vector Fields with Convolutional Neural Networks", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Byungsoo Kim;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Kim, B (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nKim, Byungsoo; Guenther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Robust feature extraction is an integral part of scientific visualization.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.", "keywords": "Deep neural network,3D cerebrovascular segmentation and visualization,maximum intensity projection (MIP),joint embedding", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030374", "refList": ["10.1109/cluster.2018.00036", "10.1109/iccv.2015.123", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.133", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.19", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934312", "10.1007/978-3-319-46487-9\\_40", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.175", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70523", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2880207", "10.1145/3309993", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00018", "10.1109/iccv.2017.244", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.632", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816059", "10.1109/pacificvis.2009.4906852", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864808", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2881523", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467431", "10.1109/tpami.2015.2439281", "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.8737", "10.1109/cvpr.2019.00244", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.165", "10.1109/bigdata.2018.8622520", "10.1007/978-3-319-46466-4\\_29", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933759", "10.1145/3197517.3201304", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742378", "10.1109/cvpr.2006.91", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742369", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934255", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4\\_28", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00041", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934332", "10.1109/cvpr.2018.00916", "10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6\\_43"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}], "len": 7}], "len": 9}, {"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13420", "year": "2018", "title": "Visualizing the Phase Space of Heterogeneous Inertial Particles in 2D Flows", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Irene Baeza Rojo;Markus H.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs. Using our method, users gain deeper insights into the dynamics of inertial particles in 2D fluids, including size-dependent separation, preferential clustering and attraction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in multiple steady and unsteady 2D flows.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13420", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2013.143", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467204", "10.1145/1618452.1618487", "10.1109/visual.1998.745323", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/visual.1996.567777", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1103/physreve.93.033108", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1109/visual.1997.663867", "10.1109/icdmw.2009.55", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346319", "10.1016/j.physd.2005.10.007", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346455", "10.1016/s0167-2789(00)00142-1", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/mcg.2014.52", "10.1117/12.906872", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1109/2945.981847", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2010.01650.x", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1111/cgf.13115", "10.1109/vast.2015.7347634", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1103/physreve.84.016406", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0022-0396(79)90152-9"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13978", "year": "2020", "title": "Phase Space Projection of Dynamical Systems", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Nemanja Bartolovic;Markus Gross;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Bartolovic, N (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nBartolovic, Nemanja; Gross, Markus; Gunther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Dynamical systems are commonly used to describe the state of time-dependent systems. In many engineering and control problems, the state space is high-dimensional making it difficult to analyze and visualize the behavior of the system for varying input conditions. We present a novel dimensionality reduction technique that is tailored to high-dimensional dynamical systems. In contrast to standard general purpose dimensionality reduction algorithms, we use energy minimization to preserve properties of the flow in the high-dimensional space. Once the projection operator is optimized, further high-dimensional trajectories are projected easily. Our 3D projection maintains a number of useful flow properties, such as critical points and flow maps, and is optimized to match geometric characteristics of the high-dimensional input, as well as optional user constraints.
