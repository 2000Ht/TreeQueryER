Effective detection and analysis of tactics can reveal the playing styles of players, as well as their strengths and weaknesses. However, tactical analysis in table tennis is challenging as the analysts can often be overwhelmed by the large quantity and high dimension of the data. Statistical charts have been extensively used by researchers to explore and visualize table tennis data. However, these charts cannot support efficient comparative and correlation analysis of complicated tactic attributes. Besides, existing studies are limited to the analysis of one match. However, one player's strategy can change along with his/her opponents in different matches. Therefore, the data of multiple matches can support a more comprehensive tactical analysis. To address these issues, we introduced a visual analytics system called Tac-Miner to allow analysts to effectively analyze, explore, and compare tactics of multiple matches based on the advanced embedding and dimension reduction algorithms along with an interactive glyph. We evaluate our glyph's usability through a user study and demonstrate the system's usefulness through a case study with insights approved by coaches and domain experts.", "doi": "tacminervisualtactic-2021", "year": 2021, "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "citationCount": 0, "keywords": "", "link": "", "refList": "", "wos": 0, "len": 1}, "index": 1637, "embedding": [-1.9954558610916138, -0.2517378628253937, -1.060706377029419, -0.32634517550468445, -0.17045269906520844, 0.16650904715061188, 5.380379676818848, 1.5225602388381958, 6.754868507385254, -0.5890102982521057, 2.0914499759674072, -0.920688271522522, 0.1905195266008377, 2.199202299118042, -0.678647518157959, -0.5592858791351318, -0.05316852033138275, 0.08175134658813477, -0.2071121335029602, 0.36516061425209045, -0.06630208343267441, 0.5449568629264832, -0.15046541392803192, -0.12925946712493896, -1.3074088096618652, 2.6810619831085205, -0.5500518083572388, -0.16255053877830505, -0.5349987745285034, -2.490147590637207, 0.27202510833740234, -0.905439555644989], "projection": [17.752731323242188, 3.4933409690856934], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
