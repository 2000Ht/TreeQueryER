Each robot in a multi-robot system that uses the shared-world coordination paradigm autonomously schedules which robot should perform a given task, and when, using its worldview\u2013the robot\u2019s internal representation of its belief about both its own state, and other robots\u2019 states. A key problem for operators is that robots\u2019 worldviews can fall out of sync (often due to weak communication links), leading to desynchronization of the robots\u2019 scheduling decisions and inconsistent emergent behavior (e.g., tasks not performed, or performed by multiple robots). Operators face the time-consuming and difficult task of making sense of the robots\u2019 scheduling decisions, detecting de-synchronizations, and pinpointing the cause by comparing every robot\u2019s worldview. To address these challenges, we introduce MOSAIC Viewer, a visual analytics system that helps operators (i) make sense of the robots\u2019 schedules and (ii) detect and conduct a root cause analysis of the robots\u2019 desynchronized worldviews. Over a year-long partnership with roboticists at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, we conduct a formative study to identify the necessary system design requirements and a qualitative evaluation with 12 roboticists. We find that MOSAIC Viewer is faster- and easier-to-use than the users\u2019 current approaches, and it allows them to stitch low-level details to formulate a high-level understanding of the robots\u2019 schedules and detect and pinpoint the cause of the desynchronized worldviews.", "keywords": "Multi-Robot Systems,Human-Subjects Qualitative Studies,Debugging,I.3.8 [Computer Graphics],Applications", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00008", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2011.185,10.1109/tvcg.2010.197,10.1109/vast.2006.261421,10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346454,10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467451,10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745298,10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346249,10.1109/tvcg.2012.213,10.1109/infvis.2003.1249018,10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934619"], "wos": 0, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1220, "embedding": [-0.5994698405265808, -0.2517378628253937, -1.060706377029419, -1.3180180788040161, -0.6745967864990234, 0.16650904715061188, 4.414851665496826, 1.4180269241333008, -0.43282294273376465, 0.6075819730758667, -0.5321184396743774, -0.5151306986808777, -0.13324885070323944, 0.08687254041433334, 0.5036775469779968, 0.5374751687049866, -0.17821377515792847, 0.08175134658813477, -0.650787889957428, -0.5219219326972961, -0.06630208343267441, 0.30334946513175964, -0.7012905478477478, -0.12925946712493896, -0.586833655834198, 0.09129026532173157, -0.1589893400669098, -0.16255053877830505, 0.14848177134990692, 2.1143321990966797, -0.9448459148406982, -0.1372460424900055], "projection": [-3.6354353427886963, -4.421464920043945], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
