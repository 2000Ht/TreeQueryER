Despite an abundance of literature on data wrangling in the context of enterprise data analysis, little is known about the specific operations, processes, and pain points journalists encounter while performing this tedious, time-consuming task. To better understand the needs of this user group, we conduct a technical observation study of 50 public repositories of data and analysis code authored by 33 professional journalists at 26 news organizations. We develop two detailed and cross-cutting taxonomies of data wrangling in computational journalism, for actions and for processes. We observe the extensive use of multiple tables, a notable gap in previous wrangling analyses. We develop a concise, actionable framework for general multi-table data wrangling that includes wrangling operations documented in our taxonomy that are without clear parallels in other work. This framework, the first to incorporate tables as first-class objects, will support future interactive wrangling tools for both computational journalism and general-purpose use. We assess the generative and descriptive power of our framework through discussion of its relationship to our set of taxonomies.", "keywords": "Computational journalism,Data journalism,Data wrangling", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030462", "refList": ["10.1145/1378773.1378792", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.219", "10.1109/vast47406.2019.8986909", "10.1145/1084805.1084812", "10.1007/s00778-008-0098-x", "10.1016/j.websem.2008.09.005", "10.18637/jss.v040.i01", "10.1145/989863.989865", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467551", "10.5281/zenodo.3509134", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934593", "10.1109/tse.2018.2796554", "10.17349/jmc117309", "10.1109/2945.981851", "10.1109/vast.2011.6102440", "10.1177/1473871611415994", "10.1145/2001269.2001288"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1106, "embedding": [-1.1965175867080688, 0.44638878107070923, -1.0404996871948242, -0.6063605546951294, -0.6897369623184204, 0.16650904715061188, 1.0600121021270752, 1.6551553010940552, -0.46884602308273315, -0.4730873703956604, -0.9582353830337524, -0.6201278567314148, -0.1686236411333084, 0.6629481911659241, 1.1107187271118164, 1.0707374811172485, -0.24749651551246643, 0.06877747178077698, -0.7571966052055359, 0.3071812689304352, -0.06630208343267441, 2.3129611015319824, -0.41712525486946106, -0.08039181679487228, -1.8205111026763916, 0.04334019869565964, -0.5834015607833862, 0.15661515295505524, 0.8799785375595093, -1.0310720205307007, -0.5554164052009583, 0.5065072774887085], "projection": [-3.9034619331359863, -0.045271020382642746], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
