A common way of representing causal relations among variables is to use node-link diagrams, where nodes depict variables and edges show relationships between them. When performing a causal analysis, analysts may be biased by the position of collected evidences, especially when they are at the top of a list. This is of crucial importance since finding a root cause or a derived effect, and searching for causal chains of inferences are essential analytic tasks when investigating causal relationships. In this paper, we examine whether sequential ordering influences understanding of indirect causal relationships and whether it improves readability of multi-attribute causal diagrams. Moreover, we see how people reason to identify a root cause or a derived effect. The results of our design study show that sequential ordering does not play a crucial role when analyzing causal relationships, but many connections from/to a variable and higher strength/certainty values may influence the process of finding a root cause and a derived effect.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13198", "refList": ["10.1177/1473871615576758", "10.1109/hicss.2013.58", "10.1037/a0014928", "10.1002/1097-024x(200009)30:11", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742390", "10.1109/pacificvis.2009.4906848", "10.1002/spe.4380211102", "10.1037/xlm0000061", "10.1080/13658810701517096", "10.1155/2016/5692852", "10.1109/infvis.2004.1", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2424872"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3028958", "title": "Auditing the Sensitivity of Graph-based Ranking with Visual Analytics", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Tiankai Xie;Yuxin Ma;Hanghang Tong;My T.

For example, what items shall we recommend to a given user on an e-commerce platform? The answers to such questions are typically returned in the form of a ranked list, and graph-based ranking methods are widely used in industrial information retrieval settings. However, these ranking algorithms have a variety of sensitivities, and even small changes in rank can lead to vast reductions in product sales and page hits. As such, there is a need for tools and methods that can help model developers and analysts explore the sensitivities of graph ranking algorithms with respect to perturbations within the graph structure. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for explaining and exploring the sensitivity of any graph-based ranking algorithm by performing perturbation-based what-if analysis. We demonstrate our framework through three case studies inspecting the sensitivity of two classic graph-based ranking algorithms (PageRank and HITS) as applied to rankings in political news media and social networks.", "keywords": "Graph-based ranking,sensitivity analysis,visual analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028958", "refList": ["10.1109/wsc.2017.8247800", "10.1023/a:1022649401552", "10.1515/1559-0410.11416", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598919", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934630", "10.1140/epjds29", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934670", "10.1016/j.eswa.2015.09.004", "10.1145/2702123.2702509", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.12.001", "10.2307/3002000", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934399", "10.1007/s41060-016-0032-z", "10.1111/cgf.13198", "10.14778/2350229.2350254", "10.1145/2939672.2939764", "10.1016/j.visinf.2017.01.006", "10.1145/2858036.2858529", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585647", "10.1007/bf01187020", "10.1109/icdm.2015.26", "10.1145/2362383.2362387", "10.1177/0049124104268644", "10.1109/vast.2011.6102442", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249025", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864475", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70528", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467691", "10.1111/cgf.13210", "10.1214/aos/1176344136", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2424872", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.09.001", "10.1177/089443939100900106", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467931", "10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735", "10.1007/s11162-011-9241-4", "10.1111/cgf.13680", "10.1145/3065386", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864889", "10.1177/003804070808100402", "10.1109/icdm.2010.62", "10.1038/s41598-020-59669-x", "10.1162/153244303321897717", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934619", "10.1007/bf00356088", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598432", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030465", "title": "Visual Causality Analysis of Event Sequence Data", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Zhuochen Jin;Shunan Guo;Nan Chen;Daniel Weiskopf;David Gotz;Nan Cao", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Cao, N (Corresponding Author), Tongji Univ, IDVx Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

Event sequence data is widely collected from many real-world processes, such as electronic health records, web clickstreams, and financial transactions, which transmit a great deal of information reflecting the causal relations among event types. Unfortunately, recovering causalities from observational event sequences is challenging, as the heterogeneous and high-dimensional event variables are often connected to rather complex underlying event excitation mechanisms that are hard to infer from limited observations. Many existing automated causal analysis techniques suffer from poor explainability and fail to include an adequate amount of human knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics method for recovering causalities in event sequence data. We extend the Granger causality analysis algorithm on Hawkes processes to incorporate user feedback into causal model refinement. The visualization system includes an interactive causal analysis framework that supports bottom-up causal exploration, iterative causal verification and refinement, and causal comparison through a set of novel visualizations and interactions. We report two forms of evaluation: a quantitative evaluation of the model improvements resulting from the user-feedback mechanism, and a qualitative evaluation through case studies in different application domains to demonstrate the usefulness of the system.", "keywords": "Event sequence data,causality analysis,visual analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030465", "refList": ["10.5555/1642718", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865022", "10.5555/2074094.2074151", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2618797", "10.1073/pnas.1320645111", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744843", "10.1109/iv.2017.69", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934399", "10.1145/3172944.3173007", "10.5555/1795555", "10.1109/mcg.2005.102", "10.1145/381641.381653", "10.1162/153244301753344614", "10.1111/cgf.14034", "10.1111/cgf.13198", "10.1017/cbo9780511519857", "10.1007/s10462-016-9475-9", "10.1075/ssol.2.2.07bor", "10.1007/978-1-4614-3223-4\\_3", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249025", "10.1007/978-94-007-6094-313", "10.1145/2858036.2858387", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70528", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2674958", "10.1147/sj.454.0801", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.119", "10.1145/3173574.3173711", "10.1016/j.erss.2017.06.034", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933695", "10.1007/s11665-016-2173-6", "10.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-7", "10.2307/3601125", "10.1016/b978-0-444-88738-2.50018-x", "10.1109/mcg.2006.70", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865145", "10.1017/s1351324997001502", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.179", "10.1214/aos/1176344552", "10.1109/mcg.2009.22", "10.1007/978-3-319-26633-6\\_13", "10.1080/10447318.2014.905422", "10.1016/j.visinf.2019.03.004", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500074", "10.1007/978-1-4614-3223-4"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 5}, "index": 1416, "embedding": [1.7721714973449707, -0.020951198413968086, 3.1616828441619873, 1.6479541063308716, -0.6495316028594971, 0.16650904715061188, -0.7182635068893433, 0.16867798566818237, -0.4013857841491699, -0.8018340468406677, 0.7613169550895691, -0.3400075137615204, -0.1336275339126587, -0.23051294684410095, 1.3291652202606201, 0.06932395696640015, 0.6796408891677856, 0.07991757988929749, -0.06386081874370575, 1.8232483863830566, -0.06630208343267441, 0.1891670674085617, 0.09139606356620789, -0.13207590579986572, -0.05761968344449997, 0.09441477060317993, -0.5399249196052551, 0.013336162082850933, -0.4558412432670593, 3.429481029510498, 0.9935886263847351, 0.8245008587837219], "projection": [-3.0517075061798096, 5.110177516937256], "size": 3, "height": 2, "width": 2}
