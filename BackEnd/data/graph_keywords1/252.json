To this end, this study aims to provide a visual system for exploring the citation relationships and motivations for citations within papers. For this purpose, papers from the IEEE Information Visualization Conference that introduce research on data visualization were collected, and based on the internal citation relationships, citation sentences were extracted and the text were analyzed. In addition, a visualization interface was provided to identify the citation relationships, citation pattern information, and citing motivation. Lastly, the pattern analysis of the citation relationships along with the citing motivation and topic was demonstrated through a case study. Our paper exploring system can confirm the purpose of specific papers being cited by other authors. Furthermore, the findings can help identify the characteristics of related studies based on the target papers.", "keywords": "Citing motivation; topic analysis; citation network; data visualization; conference paper exploring", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.1010", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2016.2615308", "10.1093/ijl/3.4.235", "10.1109/ldav.2018.8739176", "10.1002/asi.23256", "10.1177/030631277500500106", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70577", "10.2307/1932409", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.3115/1610075.1610091"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 252, "embedding": [-0.8008139729499817, 0.35869842767715454, -1.03950035572052, -0.5358214378356934, -0.6195418834686279, 0.16650904715061188, 0.18737615644931793, 1.1839146614074707, -0.41535258293151855, -0.7046082615852356, -0.55324387550354, -0.7572699189186096, -0.1268409788608551, 0.30837780237197876, 0.5486472249031067, 0.8365597128868103, -0.20178551971912384, 0.06584581732749939, -0.6218824982643127, 0.6249910593032837, -0.06630208343267441, 1.5635113716125488, -0.3874709904193878, -0.12045589834451675, -2.3459436893463135, 0.10673608630895615, -0.4969606399536133, 0.15601330995559692, 0.5337578654289246, -0.44716501235961914, -0.40116775035858154, 0.34485161304473877], "projection": [1.5193430185317993, 5.8790154457092285], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
