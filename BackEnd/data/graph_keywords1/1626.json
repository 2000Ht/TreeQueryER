However, the overall process is still challenging to be fully automated because of low image quality and variation of templates that exist in the status quo. In this paper, we propose a mixed-initiative pipeline for extracting data from pictures of medical invoices, where deep-learning-based automatic prediction models and task-specific heuristics work together under the mediation of a user. In the user study with 12 participants, we confirmed our mixed-initiative approach can supplement the drawbacks of a fully automated approach within an acceptable completion time. We further discuss the findings, limitations, and future works for designing a mixed-initiative system to extract data from pictures of a complicated table.", "doi": "mixedinitiativeappro-2021", "year": 2021, "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "citationCount": 0, "keywords": "", "link": "", "refList": "", "wos": 0, "len": 1}, "index": 1626, "embedding": [-1.8881237506866455, -0.26742973923683167, -1.0271400213241577, -0.31003087759017944, -0.1910475641489029, 0.16650904715061188, 4.877262115478516, 1.4302507638931274, 6.557957649230957, -0.6888176798820496, 2.1838364601135254, -0.9658841490745544, 0.08829163014888763, 1.8871333599090576, -0.6648035645484924, -0.5062769055366516, -0.03365722671151161, 0.0788058489561081, -0.22435054183006287, -0.0667189285159111, -0.06630208343267441, 0.33132481575012207, -0.2185245305299759, -0.114951491355896, -1.2825369834899902, 1.9319838285446167, -0.5328229665756226, -0.17058739066123962, -0.544016420841217, -2.594913959503174, 0.18127281963825226, -0.8552394509315491], "projection": [-1.1102159023284912, -19.284730911254883], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
