Each process is assigned with (1) a statically partitioned, axis-aligned data block that partially overlaps with neighboring blocks in other processes and (2) a dynamically determined k-d tree leaf node that bounds the active particles for computation; the bounds of the k-d tree nodes are constrained by the geometries of data blocks. Given a certain degree of overlap between blocks, our method can balance the number of particles as much as possible. Compared with other load-balancing algorithms for parallel particle tracing, the proposed method does not require any preanalysis, does not use any heuristics based on flow features, does not make any assumptions about seed distribution, does not move any data blocks during the run, and does not need any master process for work redistribution. Based on a comprehensive performance study up to 8K processes on a Blue Gene/Q system, the proposed algorithm outperforms baseline approaches in both load balance and scalability on various flow visualization and analysis problems.", "keywords": "Parallel particle tracing,dynamic load balancing,k-d trees,performance analysis", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744059", "refList": ["10.1109/ldav.2016.7874307", "10.1109/hipc.2016.021", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.219", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.144", "10.1109/mcg.2011.102", "10.1109/visual.1997.663898", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2004.00753.x", "10.1109/ipdps.2011.62", "10.1038/324446a0", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70551", "10.1109/cit.2010.424", "10.1109/pacificvis.2014.15", "10.5244/c.25.40", "10.1109/sc.2014.87", "10.1145/361002.361007", "10.1137/0909044", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.227", "10.1109/ldav.2013.6675152", "10.1109/hipc.2016.15", "10.1109/sc.2016.61", "10.1016/s0167-2789(00)00199-8", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2010.01650.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.128", "10.1145/1186644.1186650", "10.1145/1654059.1654113", "10.1109/pacificvis.2016.7465254"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934434", "title": "SmartCube: An Adaptive Data Management Architecture for the Real-Time Visualization of Spatiotemporal Datasets", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Can Liu 0004;Cong Wu 0004;Hanning Shao;Xiaoru Yuan", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Yuan, XR (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Sch EECS, Minist Educ, Key Lab Machine Percept, Beijing, Peoples R China.

We propose a novel architecture for spatiotemporal data management. The architecture can dynamically update itself based on user queries.

An update mechanism is designed to create or remove cuboids on it, according to the analysis of the user queries, with the consideration of memory size limitation. Data structure is dynamically optimized according to different user queries. During a query process, user queries are recorded to predict the performance increment of the new cuboid. The creation or deletion of a cuboid is determined by performance increment. Experiment results show that our prototype system deliveries good performance towards user queries on different spatiotemporal datasets, which costing small memory size with comparable performance compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.", "keywords": "data management,spatial-temporal data", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934434", "refList": ["10.1109/bigdata.2013.6691710", "10.1145/2882903.2882919", "10.1145/2207676.2208294", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346418", "10.1111/cgf.12129", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346452", "10.1109/icde.2002.994705", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744059", "10.1023/a:1009726021843", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598694", "10.1145/2465351.2465355", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2671341", "10.1109/bigdata.2013.6691708", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598624", "10.1145/564691.564745", "10.1145/361002.361007", "10.1111/cgf.13414", "10.1109/tvcg.2003.1196005", "10.1109/icde.2016.7498315", "10.1145/2020408.2020579", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.179", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.191", "10.1111/cgf.13398", "10.1109/mmcs.1996.535011", "10.1109/2945.981851", "10.1109/pacificvis.2016.7465254", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346574", "10.1145/956060.956064"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00019", "year": "2018", "title": "Dynamic Data Repartitioning for Load-Balanced Parallel Particle Tracing", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Jiang Zhang;Hanqi Guo;Xiaoru Yuan;Tom Peterka", "citationCount": "2", "affiliation": "Yuan, XR (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Key Lab Machine Percept, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nYuan, XR (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Sch EECS, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nYuan, XR (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Beijing Engn Technol Res Ctr Virtual Simulat \\& Vi, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nZhang, Jiang; Yuan, Xiaoru, Peking Univ, Key Lab Machine Percept, Minist Educ, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nZhang, Jiang; Yuan, Xiaoru, Peking Univ, Sch EECS, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nYuan, Xiaoru, Peking Univ, Beijing Engn Technol Res Ctr Virtual Simulat \\& Vi, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nGuo, Hanqi; Peterka, Tom, Argonne Natl Lab, Math \\& Comp Sci Div, Lemont, IL USA.", "countries": "USA;China", "abstract": "We present a novel dynamic load-balancing algorithm based on data repartitioning for parallel particle tracing in flow visualization. Instead of static data assignment, we dynamically repartition the data into blocks and reassign the blocks to processes to balance the workload distribution among the processes. Block repartitioning is performed based on a dynamic workload estimation method that predicts the workload in the flow field on the fly as the input. In our approach, we allow data duplication in the repartitioning, enabling the same data blocks to be assigned to multiple processes. Load balance is achieved by regularly exchanging the blocks (together with the particles in the blocks) among processes according to the output of the data repartitioning. Compared with other load-balancing algorithms, our approach does not need any preprocessing on the raw data and does not require any dedicated process for work scheduling, while it has the capability to balance uneven workload efficiently.
