NEUVis, a wicked problem, accounts for design constraints related to the affective (or emotional) response by the user. This contrasts NEUVis from the tame, but complex, problems associated with scientific visualisation. Examples of scientific visualisation and NEUVis show how the challenge of NEUVis can be overcome by collaboration between artists/designers and scientists. Current Research at the Design Lab at The University of Sydney into NEUVis aims to map the different levels of cognitive and emotional response of different modes of visualisation.", "keywords": "{[}Education and everyday visualisation]; {[}Emperical and comprehension focused visualisation research]: presentation, dissemination and storytelling", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis.2014.39", "refList": ["10.1287/mnsc.14.4.b141", "10.1016/j.jclepro.2009.09.011", "10.1007/978-3-642-23774-4\\_39", "10.2307/1511637", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.196", "10.1080/1472586x.2011.548488", "10.1109/mc.2013.166", "10.1016/j.sbspro.2012.09.253", "10.1016/0090-2616(95)90024-1", "10.1016/j.destud.2004.06.005", "10.1016/0160-791x(85)90003-x"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030464", "title": "Designing Narrative-Focused Role-Playing Games for Visualization Literacy in Young Children", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Elaine Huynh;Angela Nyhout;Patricia Ganea;Fanny Chevalier", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Huynh, E (Corresponding Author), Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game - one with narrative elements and one without - and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game. We report observations and qualitative feedback collected, and note areas for improvement and room for future work.", "keywords": "Visualization Literacy,Educational technology,Gamification,Narrative", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030464", "refList": ["10.1007/978-981-13-2694-3\\_2", "10.1145/2702123.2702298", "10.1145/2702123.2702558", "10.1007/978-981-13-2694-3\\_8", "10.1145/2702123.2702245", "10.1109/mis.2012.27", "10.18061/dsq.v21i4.318", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.134", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1007/s10708-008-9186-0", "10.1093/cje/ben057", "10.5210/fm.v16i2.3316", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598608", "10.1007/978-3-319-94659-7\\_10", "10.1109/mcg.2013.28", "10.17351/ests2017.134", "10.1109/pacificvis.2014.39", "10.1145/3173574.3173728", "10.1145/2598784.2598806", "10.1145/2491500.2491501", "10.1145/1993060.1993065", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2802520", "10.1145/3025453.3025667", "10.1145/2598510.2598566", "10.1080/15710882.2015.1081240", "10.17351/ests2017.133", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346431", "10.1016/j.ijhcs.2015.02.005", "10.1145/2702123.2702180", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70577", "10.1109/mcg.2019.2923483", "10.5931/djim.v12.i1.6449", "10.1145/3240167.3240206", "10.1145/2468356.2468739", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1145/3025453.3025751", "10.4018/978-1-4666-6497-5.ch003"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 37, "embedding": [0.2273711860179901, 0.3849542438983917, 0.2833270728588104, 0.8288940191268921, -0.6195418834686279, 0.16650904715061188, 0.9698569774627686, 1.603642225265503, -0.41535258293151855, -0.5872007608413696, 0.10773440450429916, -0.08771490305662155, -0.1268409788608551, 0.5188924074172974, 0.218387633562088, 0.7743623852729797, -0.20178551971912384, 0.06584581732749939, -0.6218824982643127, 0.3403857350349426, -0.06630208343267441, 1.8173938989639282, -0.39121121168136597, -0.12045589834451675, -0.11359020322561264, 0.10673608630895615, -0.4969606399536133, -0.16244997084140778, 0.9073720574378967, 0.3537563979625702, -0.09828098118305206, 0.391132116317749], "projection": [-4.592686176300049, 6.051423072814941], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
