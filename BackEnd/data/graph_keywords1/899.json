They help audiences understand data-related facts effectively and make a deep impression. However, designing a fact sheet requires both data and design expertise and is a laborious and time-consuming process. One needs to not only understand the data in depth but also produce intricate graphical representations. To assist in the design process, we present DataShot which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first automated system that creates fact sheets automatically from tabular data. First, we conduct a qualitative analysis of 245 infographic examples to explore general infographic design space at both the sheet and element levels. We identify common infographic structures, sheet layouts, fact types, and visualization styles during the study. Based on these findings, we propose a fact sheet generation pipeline, consisting of fact extraction, fact composition, and presentation synthesis, for the auto-generation workflow. To validate our system, we present use cases with three real-world datasets. We conduct an in-lab user study to understand the usage of our system. Our evaluation results show that DataShot can efficiently generate satisfactory fact sheets to support further customization and data presentation.", "keywords": "Fact sheet,infographic,visualization,and automated design", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934398", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598647", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865158", "10.1111/cgf.13195", "10.1145/2851141.2851145", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2829750", "10.1145/2556288.2557228", "10.1111/cgf.12392", "10.1145/3025171.3025227", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744198", "10.14778/2733004.2733035", "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031599", "10.1109/pacificvis.2009.4906837", "10.1145/22949.22950", "10.1137/1.9781611972788.22", "10.1145/2702123.2702149", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532136", "10.1109/mcg.2015.99", "10.1145/1183614.1183688", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467321", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.119", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598876", "10.1145/2470654.2481374", "10.1145/3025453.3025866", "10.1145/2901790.2901817", "10.1145/3035918.3035922", "10.1111/cgf.12391", "10.1145/3173574.3173612", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598620", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346291", "10.1145/3173574.3173909", "10.1109/mc.2013.36", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467191", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.234", "10.1177/1473871618806555", "10.1145/3173574.3173697", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.179", "10.1016/j.ijhcs.2018.01.004", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2614803"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030403", "title": "Calliope: Automatic Visual Data Story Generation from a Spreadsheet", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Danqing Shi;Xinyue Xu;Fuling Sun;Yang Shi 0007;Nan Cao", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Cao, N (Corresponding Author), Tongji Univ, Intelligent Big Data Visualizat Lab, Shanghai, Peoples R China.

Although useful, technique barriers, such as data analysis, visualization, and scripting, make the generation of a visual data story difficult. Existing authoring tools rely on users' skills and experiences, which are usually inefficient and still difficult. In this paper, we introduce a novel visual data story generating system, Calliope, which creates visual data stories from an input spreadsheet through an automatic process and facilities the easy revision of the generated story based on an online story editor. Particularly, Calliope incorporates a new logic-oriented Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the data space given by the input spreadsheet to progressively generate story pieces (i.e., data facts) and organize them in a logical order. The importance of data facts is measured based on information theory, and each data fact is visualized in a chart and captioned by an automatically generated description. We evaluate the proposed technique through three example stories, two controlled experiments, and a series of interviews with 10 domain experts. Our evaluation shows that Calliope is beneficial to efficient visual data story generation.", "keywords": "Information Visualization,Visual Storytelling,Data Story", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030403", "refList": ["10.1007/s11063-017-9759-3", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598647", "10.1162/0891201054223977", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467732", "10.3390/info9030065", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934398", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.12.001", "10.1145/2002353.2002355", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70594", "10.1111/cgf.12392", "10.14778/2831360.2831371", "10.1093/biomet/33.3.239", "10.1109/mcg.2019.2924636", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2659744", "10.1109/pacificvis.2009.4906837", "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031599", "10.4103/1755-6783.179101", "10.1145/2362394.2362398", "10.1111/cgf.12925", "10.1109/icde.2018.00019", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865240", "10.1109/mcg.2015.99", "10.1109/vds48975.2019.8973383", "10.1038/nature16961", "10.1109/tciaig.2012.2186810", "10.1145/3035918.3035922", "10.1145/3197517.3201362", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934281", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598620", "10.1155/2019/8480905", "10.1109/iccchina.2013.6671183", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865145", "10.1145/3299869.3314037", "10.1017/s1351324907004664", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934785", "10.1177/1473871618806555", "10.1613/jair.2989", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.179", "10.1145/3303766"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1111/cgf.14004", "year": "2020", "title": "Infomages: Embedding Data into Thematic Images", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Darius Coelho;Klaus Mueller", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Coelho, D (Corresponding Author), SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Comp Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.\nCoelho, D.; Mueller, K., SUNY Stony Brook, Dept Comp Sci, Stony Brook, NY 11794 USA.", "countries": "USA", "abstract": "Recent studies have indicated that visually embellished charts such as infographics have the ability to engage viewers and positively affect memorability. Fueled by these findings, researchers have proposed a variety of infographic design tools. However, these tools do not cover the entire design space. In this work, we identify a subset of infographics that we call infomages. Infomages are casual visuals of data in which a data chart is embedded into a thematic image such that the content of the image reflects the subject and the designer's interpretation of the data. Creating an effective infomage, however, can require a fair amount of design expertise and is thus out of reach for most people. In order to also afford non-artists with the means to design convincing infomages, we first study the principled design of existing infomages and identify a set of key chart embedding techniques. Informed by these findings we build a design tool that links web-scale image search with a set of interactive image processing tools to empower novice users with the ability to design a wide variety of infomages. As the embedding process might introduce some amount of visual distortion of the data our tool also aids users to gauge the amount of this distortion, if any. We experimentally demonstrate the usability of our tool and conclude with a discussion of infomages and our design tool.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14004", "refList": ["10.1109/mcg.2018.2879066", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467732", "10.1002/acp.2350030302", "10.1145/361237.361242", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934398", "10.1145/2702123.2702275", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934810", "10.1111/cgf.12634", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.221", "10.1145/2702123.2702545", "10.1145/2501988.2502046", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.197", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598609", "10.1086/209244", "10.1145/1015706.1015720", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.175", "10.1111/cgf.12888", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467321", "10.2307/2288400", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.163", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2440241", "10.1080/10447319509526110", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598620", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.234", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934785", "10.1126/science.220.4598.671", "10.1111/j.1469-8986.1993.tb03352.x", "10.1179/000870403235002042", "10.1145/2702123.2702608"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 5}, "index": 899, "embedding": [1.0302515029907227, 0.27396160364151, -1.0222129821777344, 1.554060935974121, -0.3172967731952667, 0.16650904715061188, -0.08476501703262329, 1.2991725206375122, -0.03994652256369591, 0.2462145984172821, 0.437285453081131, -0.03257359564304352, -0.1321265697479248, 0.054559532552957535, -0.7281984686851501, 0.9100635051727295, -0.16739541292190552, 0.07000205665826797, -0.6329802870750427, 2.073683023452759, -0.06630208343267441, 1.1202234029769897, -0.2850845158100128, 0.4097141623497009, -1.0530811548233032, 0.8767160773277283, -0.5019459128379822, -0.1698274314403534, 1.246006965637207, -0.995936930179596, -0.4901992380619049, -0.11503911018371582], "projection": [-1.3360676765441895, 7.141988754272461], "size": 3, "height": 2, "width": 2}
