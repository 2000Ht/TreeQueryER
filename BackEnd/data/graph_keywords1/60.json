Currently, many countries are investing heavily in policy-making process development through the ICT for this purpose. In the policy cycle, there are many opportunities in which a scientific method can be effectively applied especially in the agenda setting. In the phase, it is important to visualize a cognitive structure in a citizen. We focus on the evaluation grid method to figure out the citizen's requirement. Once we construct the cognitive structure represented by a graph in which nodes and arcs are represented as constructs and relationships between them, respectively, we can develop a predictive cognitive model which will be useful in the agenda setting. For this purpose we employ multivariate visualization techniques which can figure out meaningful relationships in the cognitive model.", "keywords": "Policy-making; Evaluation grid method; Multivariate visualization", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis.2014.62", "refList": ["10.2307/3203341"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 60, "embedding": [-0.47747182846069336, 0.2772313356399536, -1.0222129821777344, -1.681300401687622, -0.630656361579895, 0.16650904715061188, -0.6648477911949158, 0.4000544846057892, -0.4060705304145813, -0.7935177087783813, 0.022856423631310463, -1.1060467958450317, -0.1321265697479248, -0.41373223066329956, 0.137197345495224, 0.6290763020515442, -0.20636838674545288, 0.07000205665826797, -0.400410532951355, 0.7472687363624573, -0.06630208343267441, 0.36191368103027344, -0.32597726583480835, -0.1290702521800995, -2.458800792694092, 0.09817054867744446, -0.5019459128379822, 0.15276223421096802, -0.052136797457933426, 0.3615390956401825, -0.4185601770877838, 0.1088947057723999], "projection": [2.669858694076538, 4.629050254821777], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
