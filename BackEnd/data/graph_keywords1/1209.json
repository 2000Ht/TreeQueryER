The data on which a network is based, however, is rarely collected in a form that suits the analysis process, making it necessary to create and reshape networks. Data wrangling is widely acknowledged to be a critical part of the data analysis pipeline, yet interactive network wrangling has received little attention in the visualization research community. In this paper, we discuss a set of operations that are important for wrangling network datasets and introduce a visual data wrangling tool, Origraph, that enables analysts to apply these operations to their datasets. Key operations include creating a network from source data such as tables, reshaping a network by introducing new node or edge classes, filtering nodes or edges, and deriving new node or edge attributes. Our tool, Origraph, enables analysts to execute these operations with little to no programming, and to immediately visualize the results. Origraph provides views to investigate the network model, a sample of the network, and node and edge attributes. In addition, we introduce interfaces designed to aid analysts in specifying arguments for sensible network wrangling operations. We demonstrate the usefulness of Origraph in two Use Cases: first, we investigate gender bias in the film industry, and then the influence of money on the political support for the war in Yemen.", "keywords": "Graph visualization,Data abstraction,Data wrangling,Human-centered computing [Information visualization],[Human-centered computing]: Visualization systems and tools,Information systems [Graph-based database models]", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST47406.2019.8986909", "refList": ["10.1101/gr.1239303", "10.1145/1054972.1055032", "10.1016/b978-0-12-382229-1.00002-3", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744843", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.154", "10.1007/978-1-4614-7163-9315-1", "10.1073/pnas.1607151113", "10.18637/jss.v040.i01", "10.1145/1124772.1124891", "10.1177/1473871611415994", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865149", "10.1145/2598153.2598175", "10.1177/1473871613488591", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2859973", "10.1186/1471-2105-14-s19-s3", "10.1056/nejmsa066082", "10.1007/978-3-642-36763-2\\_48", "10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.01.049", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01231.x", "10.1002/cne.24084", "10.2138/am-2017-6104ccbyncnd", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346248", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01710.x", "10.1007/978-3-642-03658-3\\_47", "10.1007/978-3-319-06793-3\\_5", "10.3390/genes9110519", "10.1145/3290605.3300356", "10.1111/cgf.12883", "10.1177/1473871612462152", "10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2010.09.003", "10.1111/cgf.13610", "10.1109/vast.2010.5652520", "10.1111/evo.13318", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2811488", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1111/cgf.13184", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.116", "10.1109/biovis.2012.6378600"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030462", "title": "Table Scraps: An Actionable Framework for Multi-Table Data Wrangling From An Artifact Study of Computational Journalism", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Stephen Kasica;Charles Berret;Tamara Munzner", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Kasica, S (Corresponding Author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Comp Sci, Vancouver, BC, Canada.

Despite an abundance of literature on data wrangling in the context of enterprise data analysis, little is known about the specific operations, processes, and pain points journalists encounter while performing this tedious, time-consuming task. To better understand the needs of this user group, we conduct a technical observation study of 50 public repositories of data and analysis code authored by 33 professional journalists at 26 news organizations. We develop two detailed and cross-cutting taxonomies of data wrangling in computational journalism, for actions and for processes. We observe the extensive use of multiple tables, a notable gap in previous wrangling analyses. We develop a concise, actionable framework for general multi-table data wrangling that includes wrangling operations documented in our taxonomy that are without clear parallels in other work. This framework, the first to incorporate tables as first-class objects, will support future interactive wrangling tools for both computational journalism and general-purpose use. We assess the generative and descriptive power of our framework through discussion of its relationship to our set of taxonomies.", "keywords": "Computational journalism,Data journalism,Data wrangling", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030462", "refList": ["10.1145/1378773.1378792", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.219", "10.1109/vast47406.2019.8986909", "10.1145/1084805.1084812", "10.1007/s00778-008-0098-x", "10.1016/j.websem.2008.09.005", "10.18637/jss.v040.i01", "10.1145/989863.989865", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467551", "10.5281/zenodo.3509134", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934593", "10.1109/tse.2018.2796554", "10.17349/jmc117309", "10.1109/2945.981851", "10.1109/vast.2011.6102440", "10.1177/1473871611415994", "10.1145/2001269.2001288"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1209, "embedding": [0.1506679207086563, 0.7770621180534363, 0.5798766613006592, 1.484586477279663, -0.630656361579895, 0.16650904715061188, -0.10953610390424728, 1.8105608224868774, -0.4060705304145813, -0.7935177087783813, 0.13779316842556, 0.7424745559692383, -0.1321265697479248, 1.9021546840667725, 0.7786036729812622, 0.7668077349662781, -0.16029003262519836, 0.07000205665826797, -0.6329802870750427, -0.9544993042945862, -0.06630208343267441, 1.8771450519561768, 0.14507970213890076, -0.1290702521800995, 0.7933124303817749, 0.09817054867744446, -0.5019459128379822, 0.22062446177005768, 1.742531180381775, -0.9756355285644531, 0.2770398259162903, 0.8419224619865417], "projection": [-4.601507663726807, 7.422365665435791], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
