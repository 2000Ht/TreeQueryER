In this work, we explore a novel advection-based scheme to manage flow field data for both efficiency and scalability. The key is to first partition flow field into blocklets (e.g. cells or very fine-grained blocks of cells), and then (pre)fetch and manage blocklets on-demand using a parallel key-value store. The benefits are (1) greatly increasing the scale of local-range analysis (e.g. source-destination queries, streak surface generation) that can fit within any given limit of hardware resources; (2) improving memory and I/O bandwidth-efficiencies as well as the scalability of naive task-parallel particle advection. We demonstrate our method using a prototype system that works on workstation and also in supercomputing environments. Results show significantly reduced I/O overhead compared to accessing raw flow data, and also high scalability on a supercomputer for a variety of applications.", "keywords": "Flow visualization, Data management, High performance visualization, Key-value store", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346418", "refList": ["10.1145/362686.362692", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183585", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.219", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.259", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.144", "10.1109/mcg.2011.102", "10.1109/visual.1997.663898", "10.1109/bigdata.2013.6691578", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2004.00753.x", "10.1109/ipdps.2011.62", "10.1109/mcg.2011.13", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.154", "10.1109/ldav.2012.6378984", "10.1109/ipdps.2013.110", "10.1016/j.cag.2012.07.006", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70551", "10.1109/pacificvis.2014.15", "10.1145/1073204.1073278", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.227", "10.1145/258533.258660", "10.1007/s002360050048", "10.1016/s0167-2789(00)00199-8", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2010.01650.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1046", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.128"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/scivis.2015.7429515", "title": "High performance flow field visualization with high-order access dependencies", "year": "2015", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Jiang Zhang 0002;Hanqi Guo;Xiaoru Yuan", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Zhang, J (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Machine Percept, Beijing, Peoples R China.

In situ visualization, generating visualizations at simulation time, is becoming prevalent in handling large-scale simulations because of the I/O and storage constraints.

Although multiple image-based approaches have been proposed to mitigate this limitation, those approaches lack the ability to explore the simulation parameters. Our approach allows flexible exploration of parameter space for large-scale ensemble simulations by taking advantage of the recent advances in deep learning. Specifically, we design InSituNet as a convolutional regression model to learn the mapping from the simulation and visualization parameters to the visualization results. With the trained model, users can generate new images for different simulation parameters under various visualization settings, which enables in-depth analysis of the underlying ensemble simulations.

The five most important properties identified in the existing literature include coincidence with the steady case, induction of a partition within the domain, Lagrangian invariance, objectivity, and Galilean invariance.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14037", "refList": ["10.2514/6.1995-1715", "10.1111/cgf.12100", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_1", "10.1111/cgf.12885", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934312", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.92", "10.1063/1.166399", "10.1109/tvcg.2005.68.3", "10.1063/1.4971788", "10.1111/cgf.12933", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1063/1.4982720", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864432", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.93", "10.1109/pacificvis.2016.7465253", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864505", "10.1063/1.858828", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934255", "10.5194/npg-9-237-2002", "10.1063/1.4800210", "10.1007/978-3-540-88606-8\\_12", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01942.x", "10.1109/2945.928168", "10.1007/978-3-662-10388-31", "10.1016/j.physd.2013.01.013", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1017/s002211209900720x", "10.1017/s0022112097008057", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01546.x", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03089.x", "10.1111/cgf.13319", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934375.3", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002.4", "10.1016/s0167-2789(00)00142-1", "10.1111/cgf.12359", "10.1103/physreve.93.063107", "10.1016/j.physd.2009.05.005", "10.1063/1.1477449", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01686.x", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742374", "10.1017/jfm.2013.391", "10.1111/cgf.12121", "10.1186/1743-422x-3-15", "10.1063/1.3502450", "10.1063/1.868323", "10.1016/j.cnsns.2013.05.002", "10.1109/visual.2004.99", "10.1109/visual.2004.107", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01604.x", "10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141322", "10.1063/1.3690153", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934375", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.143", "10.1137/130940633", "10.1016/j.cag.2014.01.007", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.284", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.265", "10.1017/jfm.2016.792", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.208", "10.1007/s12650-016-0348-8", "10.1023/b:elas.0000005548.36767.e7", "10.1007/978-1-4939-0419-8\\_\\_9", "10.1007/bf00849110", "10.1615/int.j.uncertaintyquantification.2012003956", "10.1017/s0022112096001802", "10.1017/s0962492902000065", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00041", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01901.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.33", "10.1016/j.physd.2005.10.007", "10.1016/s0894-1777(96)00090-8", "10.1145/2517327.2442526", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2743938", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816059", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934242", "10.2514/6.1995-1715.4", "10.1111/cgf.12109", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.269", "10.1109/visual.1990.146359", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2003.00723.x", "10.5194/npg-18-977-2011", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70557", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2312012"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 11}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934255", "title": "TSR-TVD: Temporal Super-Resolution for Time-Varying Data Analysis and Visualization", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Jun Han;Chaoli Wang", "citationCount": "5", "affiliation": "Han, J (Corresponding Author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Comp Sci \\& Engn, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically.
