Recent advances in the visualization and analysis of 2D asymmetric tensor fields focus on pointwise analysis of the tensor field and effective visualization metaphors such as colors, glyphs, and hyperstreamlines. In this paper, we provide a novel multi-scale topological analysis framework for asymmetric tensor fields on surfaces. Our multi-scale framework is based on the notions of eigenvalue and eigenvector graphs. At the core of our framework are the identification of atomic operations that modify the graphs and the scale definition that guides the order in which the graphs are simplified to enable clarity and focus for the visualization of topological analysis on data of different sizes. We also provide efficient algorithms to realize these operations. Furthermore, we provide physical interpretation of these graphs. To demonstrate the utility of our system, we apply our multi-scale analysis to data in computational fluid dynamics.", "keywords": "Tensor field visualization,tensor field topology,2D asymmetric tensor fields,2D asymmetric tensor field topology,eigenvalue graphs,eigenvector graphs", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934314", "refList": ["10.1109/38.219447", "10.1115/1.2910248", "10.1007/s00454-002-2885-2", "10.1109/visual.2002.1183784", "10.1111/cgf.12890", "10.1145/3130800.3130844", "10.1109/visual.2001.964507", "10.1109/tvcg.2004.3", "10.1109/38.79452", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2484343", "10.1145/566282.566307", "10.1145/1276377.1276446", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03231.x", "10.1145/237170.237216", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.68", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2440250", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.170", "10.1109/pacificvis.2013.6596154", "10.1109/visual.2004.59", "10.1109/tvcg.2005.4", "10.1145/1239451.1239506", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.16", "10.1002/mrm.20318", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598998", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.199", "10.1109/tvcg.2005.67", "10.1109/visual.1998.745312", "10.2307/2154652", "10.1145/1183287.1183290", "10.1007/978-3-642-23175-9\\_13"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3028893", "title": "A Suggestive Interface for Untangling Mathematical Knots", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Huan Liu;Hui Zhang 0006", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Zhang, H (Corresponding Author), Univ Louisville, Louisville, KY 40292 USA.

Rather than treating mathematical knots as if they were 3D ropes, our interface is designed to assist the user to interact with knots with the right sequence of mathematically legal moves. Our knot interface allows one to sketch and untangle knots by proposing the Reidemeister moves, and can guide the user to untangle mathematical knots to the fewest possible number of crossings by suggesting the moves needed. The system highlights parts of the knot where the Reidemeister moves are applicable, suggests the possible moves, and constrains the user's drawing to legal moves only. This ongoing suggestion is based on a Reidemeister move analyzer, that reads the evolving knot in its Gauss code and predicts the needed Reidemeister moves towards the fewest possible number of crossings. For our principal test case of mathematical knot diagrams, this for the first time permits us to visualize, analyze, and deform them in a mathematical visual interface. In addition, understanding of a fairly long mathematical deformation sequence in our interface can be aided by visual analysis and comparison over the identified \u201ckey moments\u201d where only critical changes occur in the sequence. Our knot interface allows users to track and trace mathematical knot deformation with a significantly reduced number of visual frames containing only the Reidemeister moves being applied. All these combine to allow a much cleaner exploratory interface for us to analyze and study mathematical knots and their dynamics in topological space.", "keywords": "Knot theory,Reidemeister moves,Gauss code,Mathematical visualization,Suggestive interface", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028893", "refList": ["10.1109/visual.2004.28", "10.1109/38.219447", "10.1177/0278364904045469", "10.1017/s0025557200179598", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2484343", "10.1142/s0218216516500590", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03231.x", "10.1109/pg.2007.64", "10.1109/2.299415", "10.1016/s0022-5096(00)00023-5", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.242", "10.1145/301970.301971", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01147.x", "10.1016/j.gmod.2005.01.004", "10.1145/3095140.3095179", "10.1145/357994.358023", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70593", "10.1145/37402.37422", "10.13001/1081-3810.1999", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346425", "10.1038/nmat3134", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934314", "10.1109/38.20317"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 884, "embedding": [0.08165294677019119, 0.6982744932174683, 0.9323716163635254, 1.2990208864212036, -0.6897369623184204, 0.16650904715061188, -0.664513111114502, 1.2250080108642578, -0.46884602308273315, -0.9566591382026672, 0.08020617067813873, 0.3544260561466217, -0.1686236411333084, 0.9222368001937866, 0.29868391156196594, 0.6121170520782471, -0.02438923344016075, 0.06877747178077698, -0.7571966052055359, 0.27818208932876587, -0.06630208343267441, 1.323330283164978, -0.2289576679468155, -0.1691095381975174, 0.20336753129959106, 0.04334019869565964, -0.5834015607833862, -0.031094755977392197, 1.3850467205047607, -0.46183210611343384, 0.2977290749549866, 0.7235268950462341], "projection": [-4.42044734954834, 7.054508686065674], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
