Parameters of a log record are shown as pixels and these pixels are stacked to represent a record. This allows a broad view of a data set on one screen while staying very close to the raw data and to expose common and rare patterns of user behavior through the visualization itself (the \"Carpet\"). Visualizations that immediately point to areas of suspicious activity without requiring extensive filtering, help network engineers investigating unknown computer security incidents. Most of them, however, have limited knowledge of advanced visualization techniques, while many designers and data scientists are unfamiliar with computer security topics. To bridge this gap, we developed visualizations together with engineers, following a co-creative process. We will show how we explored the scope of the engineers' tasks and how we jointly developed ideas and designs. Our expert evaluation indicates that this visualization helps to scan large parts of log files quickly and to define areas of interest for closer inspection.", "keywords": "Pixel-oriented techniques, task and requirements analysis, multidimensional data, network security and intrusion", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2014.7042483", "refList": ["10.1145/2517957.2517959", "10.1109/2945.841121", "10.1109/ths.2011.6107916", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532134", "10.1109/visual.1991.175795", "10.1109/2945.722299", "10.1109/mcg.2013.101", "10.1057/palgrave/ivs/9500006", "10.1108/17440081311316361", "10.1080/15710880701875068", "10.1007/978-3-540-78243-8\\_6", "10.1177/154193120504900304", "10.1007/978-3-540-85933-8\\_1", "10.1080/15710880500135987", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.160", "10.1109/iv.2009.52", "10.1057/palgrave/ivs/9500003", "10.1016/j.cag.2013.10.006", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1145/1357054.1357286"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13981", "year": "2020", "title": "Co-creating Visualizations: A First Evaluation with Social Science Researchers", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Gabriela Molina Le{\\'{o}}n;Andreas Breiter", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Leon, GM (Corresponding Author), Univ Bremen, Bremen, Germany.\nLeon, G.

In this paper, we present and evaluate the use of co-creation to design a visual information system with social science researchers in order to explore and analyze their data. Co-creation proposes involving the future users in the design process to ensure that they play a critical role in the design, and to increase the chances of long-term adoption. We evaluated the co-creation process through surveys, interviews and a user study. According to the participants' feedback, they felt listened to through co-creation, and considered the methodology helpful to develop visualizations that support their research in the near future. However, participation was far from perfect, particularly early career researchers showed limited interest in participating because they did not see the process as beneficial for their research publication goals. We summarize benefits and limitations of co-creation, together with our recommendations, as lessons learned.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13981", "refList": ["10.1080/15710882.2015.1091894", "10.1145/2753509.2753515", "10.1016/j.tourman.2012.02.002", "10.1145/2940299.2940303", "10.1145/2145204.2145307", "10.1145/1409040.1409043", "10.1145/3170358.3170372", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.209", "10.1080/15710880701875068", "10.1145/1979742.1979655", "10.1109/iv.2011.32", "10.1145/1879831.1879836", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865241", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744718", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042483", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.160", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1145/3027063.3053244.2", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.145", "10.1080/14719037.2014.930505"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1125, "embedding": [-0.05516863986849785, -0.1282857060432434, -1.0404996871948242, -0.2519027292728424, 0.28601348400115967, 0.16650904715061188, -0.664513111114502, 0.9456184506416321, 0.9396263360977173, 0.5286229252815247, 0.22019127011299133, -0.2842317521572113, -0.1686236411333084, -1.3357385396957397, -0.99098140001297, -0.4714091718196869, 0.36076119542121887, 0.06877747178077698, -0.7571966052055359, 0.027251940220594406, -0.06630208343267441, -0.2455267757177353, -0.960966944694519, 0.0831855833530426, -0.948030948638916, 0.04334019869565964, -0.5834015607833862, -0.21145495772361755, 0.6617404818534851, -1.6268401145935059, -0.5733597874641418, -0.5460958480834961], "projection": [-1.7485723495483398, 8.631181716918945], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
