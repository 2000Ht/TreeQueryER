Alternatively, the use of direct manipulation tools is popular among animation designers, but these tools have limited support for generating graphics driven by data. Our goal is to inform the design of next-generation animated data graphic authoring tools. To understand the composition of animated data graphics, we survey real-world examples and contribute a description of the design space. We characterize animated transitions based on object, graphic, data, and timing dimensions. We synthesize the primitives from the object, graphic, and data dimensions as a set of 10 transition types, and describe how timing primitives compose broader pacing techniques. We then conduct an ideation study that uncovers how people approach animation creation with three authoring paradigms: keyframe animation, procedural animation, and presets \\& templates. Our analysis shows that designers have an overall preference for keyframe animation. However, we find evidence that an authoring tool should combine these three paradigms as designers' preferences depend on the characteristics of the animated transition design and the authoring task. Based on these findings, we contribute guidelines and design considerations for developing future animated data graphic authoring tools.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13974", "refList": ["10.1145/168642.168648.1", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598647", "10.1007/978-0-387-98141-3\\_1", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346424", "10.1111/cgf.13195", "10.1145/2702123.2702431", "10.2307/2529310", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1145/2556288.2556987", "10.1177/001316446002000104", "10.1145/2897586.2897597", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467271", "10.1007/s00146-006-0050-9", "10.1145/2909132.2909255", "10.1145/3277893.3277896", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70539", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70415", "10.1145/168642.168648", "10.1109/chase.2016.020", "10.1111/cgf.12635", "10.1145/2642918"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1564, "embedding": [-1.9697543382644653, -0.24827826023101807, -1.0626764297485352, -0.3133954405784607, -0.20304404199123383, 0.16650904715061188, 5.487421035766602, 1.4839154481887817, 6.381003379821777, -0.5729827284812927, 2.02614426612854, -0.9405134320259094, 0.19541630148887634, 2.248530626296997, -0.6561029553413391, -0.5703742504119873, -0.08084333688020706, 0.07420150190591812, -0.22253474593162537, 0.5700315833091736, -0.06630208343267441, 0.602672278881073, -0.10324677079916, -0.13057257235050201, -1.3603376150131226, 2.6052417755126953, -0.5483691096305847, -0.1611158847808838, -0.529516339302063, -2.4690706729888916, 0.27074241638183594, -0.9136355519294739], "projection": [9.019914627075195, -12.925454139709473], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
