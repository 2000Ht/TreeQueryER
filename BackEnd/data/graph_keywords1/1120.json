With the advent of new technologies that allow all players and the ball to be tracked across the entire field, it is now possible to bring this understanding to another level. From discrete positions across time, we present techniques to reconstruct entire baseball games and visually explore each play. This provides opportunities to not only derive new metrics for the game, but also allow us to investigate existing measures with targeted visualizations. In addition, our techniques allow users to filter on demand so specific situations can be analyzed both in general and according to those situations. We show that gameplay can be accurately reconstructed from the raw position data and discuss how visualization and statistical methods can combine to better inform baseball analyses.", "keywords": "sports visualization, sports analytics, baseball, game reconstruction, baseball metrics, event data", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2014.7042478", "refList": ["10.1109/msp.2007.906023", "10.1016/j.cviu.2008.03.001", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.192", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.225", "10.1109/visual.2001.964496", "10.1109/2.989928", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03118.x", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01670.x", "10.1016/j.cviu.2008.10.001", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.263", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500178"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598415", "title": "A Visual Analytics Approach for Understanding Reasons behind Snowballing and Comeback in MOBA Games", "year": "2016", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Quan Li;Peng Xu;Yeukyin Chan;Yun Wang 0012;Zhipeng Wang;Huamin Qu;Xiaojuan Ma", "citationCount": "13", "affiliation": "Li, Q (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Univ Sci \\& Technol, Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

Although it is easy to identify these two types of occurrences, game developers often find it difficult to determine their causes and triggers with so many game design choices and game parameters involved. In addition, the huge amounts of MOBA game data are often heterogeneous, multi-dimensional and highly dynamic in terms of space and time, which poses special challenges for analysts. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system to help game designers find key events and game parameters resulting in snowballing or comeback occurrences in MOBA game data. We follow a user-centered design process developing the system with game analysts and testing with real data of a trial version MOBA game from NetEase Inc. We apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established ones to depict the evolution of players' positions, status and the occurrences of events. Our system can reveal players' strategies and performance throughout a single match and suggest patterns, e.g., specific player' actions and game events, that have led to the final occurrences. We further demonstrate a workflow of leveraging human analyzed patterns to improve the scalability and generality of match data analysis. Finally, we validate the usability of our system by proving the identified patterns are representative in snowballing or comeback matches in a one-month-long MOBA tournament dataset.", "keywords": "Game play data visualization;visual knowledge discovery;visual knowledge representation;and game reconstruction", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598415", "refList": ["10.1109/gem.2014.7048109", "10.1016/j.cag.2013.11.010", "10.1109/mcg.2013.26", "10.1007/s00371-013-0892-3", "10.1145/958720.958735", "10.5555/958720.958735", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.192", "10.1007/978-3-319-24589-8\\_9", "10.1016/j.entcom.2013.02.002", "10.1089/cyber.2011.0387", "10.1109/visual.2004.120", "10.1145/2702123.2702447", "10.1109/vast.2015.7347633", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.263", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042477", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042478", "10.3390/ijgi4042159", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042533", "10.1145/1389095.1389394", "10.1145/800049.801756", "10.1109/tciaig.2015.2466240", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346445"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/vast.2018.8802454", "title": "EmbeddingVis: A Visual Analytics Approach to Comparative Network Embedding Inspection", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Quan Li;Kristanto Sean Njotoprawiro;Hammad Haleem;Qiaoan Chen;Chris Yi;Xiaojuan Ma", "citationCount": "2", "affiliation": "Li, Q (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Univ Sci \\& Technol, Dept Comp Sci \\& Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

A successful MMORPG should engage players and meet their needs to achieve different cate-gories of gratifications. Research on the evolution of player social interaction network and the dynamics of inter-player intimacy could provide insights into players' gratification-oriented behaviors in MMORPGs. Such understanding could in turn guide game designs for better engaging existing players and marketing strategies for attracting newcomers. Conventional dynamic network analysis may help investigate game-based social interactions at the macroscopic level. However, current dynamic network visualization techniques mainly focus on illustrating topological changes of the entire network, which are unsuitable for analyzing player-specific social interactions in the virtual world from an egocentric perspective. In general, game designers and operators find it difficult to analyze the way players with different gratification needs may interact with one another and the consequences on their relationships with direct ties, using a decentralized social graph with complicated time-varying structures. In this paper, we present MMOSeer, a visual analytics system for exploring the evolution of egocentric player intimacy network. MMOSeer focuses on the relationship between a player (ego) and his/her directly-linked friends (alters). We follow a user-centered design process to develop the system with game analysts and apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established algorithms to depict the evolution of intimacy egocentric network. We also derive a centrality change metric to infer how the impact of changes in an ego's interactive behaviors may propagate through the intimacy network, reshaping the structure of the alters' social circles at both micro and macro levels. Finally, we validate the usability of MMOSeer by discovering different user interaction patterns and the corresponding ego-network structural changes in a real-world gameplay dataset from a commercial MMORPG.", "keywords": "H.5.2 {[}INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION]: User Interfaces-Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2017.8031576", "refList": ["10.1108/s0163-239620140000043016", "10.1007/s12110-003-1016-y", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.11", "10.1109/itw.2010.5593358", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.263", "10.1007/978-3-540-85891-1\\_8", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.254", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.142", "10.1089/cpb.2007.0066", "10.1109/iv.2013.57", "10.1109/asonam.2012.39", "10.1145/2556288.2557010", "10.1145/2512938.2512949", "10.1145/2531602.2531642", "10.1016/j.ipm.2011.09.001", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742388", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598415", "10.1080/13691180903266952", "10.1109/infvis.2001.963274", "10.1109/iv.2011.93", "10.1089/cpb.2007.9988", "10.1109/iv.2013.8", "10.1007/bf02289565", "10.5555/2999134.2999195"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/vast.2018.8802415", "title": "Segue: Overviewing Evolution Patterns of Egocentric Networks by Interactive Construction of Spatial Layouts", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Po-Ming Law;Yanhong Wu;Rahul C.

To find the causes of air pollution, the propagation processes of air pollutants must be studied at a large spatial scale. However, the complex and dynamic wind fields lead to highly uncertain pollutant transportation. The state-of-the-art data mining approaches cannot fully support the extensive analysis of such uncertain spatiotemporal propagation processes across multiple districts without the integration of domain knowledge. The limitation of these automated approaches motivates us to design and develop AirVis, a novel visual analytics system that assists domain experts in efficiently capturing and interpreting the uncertain propagation patterns of air pollution based on graph visualizations. Designing such a system poses three challenges: a) the extraction of propagation patterns; b) the scalability of pattern presentations; and c) the analysis of propagation processes. To address these challenges, we develop a novel pattern mining framework to model pollutant transportation and extract frequent propagation patterns efficiently from large-scale atmospheric data. Furthermore, we organize the extracted patterns hierarchically based on the minimum description length (MDL) principle and empower expert users to explore and analyze these patterns effectively on the basis of pattern topologies. We demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach through two case studies conducted with a real-world dataset and positive feedback from domain experts.", "keywords": "Air pollution propagation,pattern mining,graph visualization", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934670", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598919", "10.1093/bib/bbr069", "10.1145/2487575.2488188", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.193", "10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.12.011", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.226", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864503", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2468111", "10.1109/icicta.2015.183", "10.1016/j.atmosenv.2014.05.039", "10.1111/cgf.12791", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01451.x", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01898.x", "10.5194/acp-12-5031-2012", "10.1016/j.atmosenv.2008.05.053", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2535234", "10.1016/j.atmosres.2014.12.003", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467194", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.263", "10.1109/icdm.2002.1184038", "10.1145/2783258.2788573", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865149", "10.1109/tbdata.2017.2723899", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.311", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1007/s12650-018-0481-7", "10.1016/j.envpol.2007.06.012", "10.3155/1047-3289.61.6.660", "10.1080/13658810701349037", "10.1145/3097983.3098090", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70523", "10.1115/1.2128636", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467619", "10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2016.01.19", "10.1109/tkde.2005.127", "10.1017/s0269888912000331", "10.2312/conf/eg2013/stars/039-063", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346271", "10.1175/bams-d-14-00110.1", "10.1016/0005-1098(78)90005-5", "10.1007/s10618-006-0044-8", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865126", "10.2307/1912791", "10.3390/su6085322", "10.1007/s12650-018-0489-z", "10.2312/eurovisstar.20151109", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.181", "10.1126/science.298.5594.824", "10.1162/jmlr.2003.3.4-5.951", "10.1109/asonam.2014.6921638", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01213.x", "10.1038/s41598-017-18107-1", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865041", "10.1109/tits.2019.2901117", "10.1038/srep20668", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.265", "10.1109/tpami.2016.2608884", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1145/1376616.1376661", "10.1007/s00521-019-04567-1", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745083", "10.1126/science.243.4892.745", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864826", "10.1109/tnn.2003.820440", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598885", "10.1145/3219819.3219822", "10.1073/pnas.1502596112", "10.1016/j.envsoft.2009.01.004", "10.1002/pmic.200700095", "10.1145/2254556.2254651", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598432", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.202"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3028958", "title": "Auditing the Sensitivity of Graph-based Ranking with Visual Analytics", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Tiankai Xie;Yuxin Ma;Hanghang Tong;My T.

This paper approaches this challenge by leveraging unit visualization techniques that enable the investigation of many-to-many relationships between dynamically varied multi-scalar aggregations of urban traffic data and neural network predictions. Through regular exchanges with a domain expert, we design and develop a visual analytics solution that integrates 1) a Bivariate Map equipped with an advanced bivariate colormap to simultaneously depict input traffic and prediction errors across space, 2) a Moran's I Scatterplot that provides local indicators of spatial association analysis, and 3) a Multi-scale Attribution View that arranges non-linear dot plots in a tree layout to promote model analysis and comparison across scales. We evaluate our approach through a series of case studies involving a real-world dataset of Shenzhen taxi trips, and through interviews with domain experts.

Conventional methods for constructing density maps are mainly based on Euclidean distance, limiting their applicability in urban analysis that shall consider road network and urban traffic. In this work, we propose a new method named Topology Density Map, targeting for accurate and intuitive density maps in the context of urban environment. Based on the various constraints of road connections and traffic conditions, the method first constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) that propagates nonlinear scalar fields along 1D road networks.

However, these ranking algorithms have a variety of sensitivities, and even small changes in rank can lead to vast reductions in product sales and page hits. As such, there is a need for tools and methods that can help model developers and analysts explore the sensitivities of graph ranking algorithms with respect to perturbations within the graph structure.

Through the inclusion of patient-specific data, such simulations may facilitate personalized treatment and customized surgical interventions. Difficulties in spine modelling and simulation can be partly attributed to poor result representation, which may also be a hindrance when introducing such techniques into a clinical environment.

Trajectories in sports, such as the movement of players and balls, contain rich information on player behavior and thus have been widely analyzed by coaches and analysts to improve the players' performance. However, existing visual analytics systems often present the trajectories in court diagrams that are abstractions of reality, thereby causing difficulty for the experts to imagine the situation on the court and understand why the player acted in a certain way. With recent developments in immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), experts gradually have the opportunity to see, feel, explore, and understand these 3D trajectories from the player's perspective. Yet, few research has studied how to support immersive analysis of sports data from such a perspective. Specific challenges are rooted in data presentation (e.g., how to seamlessly combine 2D and 3D visualizations) and interaction (e.g., how to naturally interact with data without keyboard and mouse) in VR. To address these challenges, we have worked closely with domain experts who have worked for a top national badminton team to design ShuttleSpace. Our system leverages 1) the peripheral vision to combine the 2D and 3D visualizations and 2) the VR controller to support natural interactions via a stroke metaphor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ShuttleSpace through three case studies conducted by the experts with useful insights.

We propose a well-established hybrid second-order Markov chain model to characterize and simulate the competition process in table tennis. Compared with existing methods, our approach is the first to support the effective simulation of tactics, which represent high-level competition strategies in table tennis. Furthermore, we introduce a visual analytics system called Tac-Simur based on the proposed model for simulative visual analytics. Tac-Simur enables users to easily navigate different players and their tactics based on their respective performance in matches to identify the player and the tactics of interest for further analysis. Then, users can utilize the system to interactively explore diverse simulation tasks and visually explain the simulation results. The effectiveness and usefulness of this work are demonstrated by two case studies, in which domain experts utilize Tac-Simur to find interesting and valuable insights. The domain experts also provide positive feedback on the usability of Tac-Simur.

For example, what items shall we recommend to a given user on an e-commerce platform? The answers to such questions are typically returned in the form of a ranked list, and graph-based ranking methods are widely used in industrial information retrieval settings. However, these ranking algorithms have a variety of sensitivities, and even small changes in rank can lead to vast reductions in product sales and page hits. As such, there is a need for tools and methods that can help model developers and analysts explore the sensitivities of graph ranking algorithms with respect to perturbations within the graph structure. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for explaining and exploring the sensitivity of any graph-based ranking algorithm by performing perturbation-based what-if analysis.

Trajectories in sports, such as the movement of players and balls, contain rich information on player behavior and thus have been widely analyzed by coaches and analysts to improve the players' performance. However, existing visual analytics systems often present the trajectories in court diagrams that are abstractions of reality, thereby causing difficulty for the experts to imagine the situation on the court and understand why the player acted in a certain way. With recent developments in immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), experts gradually have the opportunity to see, feel, explore, and understand these 3D trajectories from the player's perspective. Yet, few research has studied how to support immersive analysis of sports data from such a perspective. Specific challenges are rooted in data presentation (e.g., how to seamlessly combine 2D and 3D visualizations) and interaction (e.g., how to naturally interact with data without keyboard and mouse) in VR. To address these challenges, we have worked closely with domain experts who have worked for a top national badminton team to design ShuttleSpace. Our system leverages 1) the peripheral vision to combine the 2D and 3D visualizations and 2) the VR controller to support natural interactions via a stroke metaphor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ShuttleSpace through three case studies conducted by the experts with useful insights.

However, adequately simulating the complex competition process and effectively explaining the simulation result to domain experts are typically challenging. This work presents a design study to address these challenges in table tennis. We propose a well-established hybrid second-order Markov chain model to characterize and simulate the competition process in table tennis. Compared with existing methods, our approach is the first to support the effective simulation of tactics, which represent high-level competition strategies in table tennis. Furthermore, we introduce a visual analytics system called Tac-Simur based on the proposed model for simulative visual analytics. Tac-Simur enables users to easily navigate different players and their tactics based on their respective performance in matches to identify the player and the tactics of interest for further analysis. Then, users can utilize the system to interactively explore diverse simulation tasks and visually explain the simulation results.

For example, what items shall we recommend to a given user on an e-commerce platform? The answers to such questions are typically returned in the form of a ranked list, and graph-based ranking methods are widely used in industrial information retrieval settings. However, these ranking algorithms have a variety of sensitivities, and even small changes in rank can lead to vast reductions in product sales and page hits. As such, there is a need for tools and methods that can help model developers and analysts explore the sensitivities of graph ranking algorithms with respect to perturbations within the graph structure. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for explaining and exploring the sensitivity of any graph-based ranking algorithm by performing perturbation-based what-if analysis. We demonstrate our framework through three case studies inspecting the sensitivity of two classic graph-based ranking algorithms (PageRank and HITS) as applied to rankings in political news media and social networks.", "keywords": "Graph-based ranking,sensitivity analysis,visual analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028958", "refList": ["10.1109/wsc.2017.8247800", "10.1023/a:1022649401552", "10.1515/1559-0410.11416", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598919", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934630", "10.1140/epjds29", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934670", "10.1016/j.eswa.2015.09.004", "10.1145/2702123.2702509", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.12.001", "10.2307/3002000", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934399", "10.1007/s41060-016-0032-z", "10.1111/cgf.13198", "10.14778/2350229.2350254", "10.1145/2939672.2939764", "10.1016/j.visinf.2017.01.006", "10.1145/2858036.2858529", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585647", "10.1007/bf01187020", "10.1109/icdm.2015.26", "10.1145/2362383.2362387", "10.1177/0049124104268644", "10.1109/vast.2011.6102442", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249025", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864475", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70528", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467691", "10.1111/cgf.13210", "10.1214/aos/1176344136", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2424872", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.09.001", "10.1177/089443939100900106", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467931", "10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735", "10.1007/s11162-011-9241-4", "10.1111/cgf.13680", "10.1145/3065386", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864889", "10.1177/003804070808100402", "10.1109/icdm.2010.62", "10.1038/s41598-020-59669-x", "10.1162/153244303321897717", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934619", "10.1007/bf00356088", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598432", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030358", "title": "Once Upon A Time In Visualization: Understanding the Use of Textual Narratives for Causality", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Arjun Choudhry;Mandar Sharma;Pramod Chundury;Thomas Kapler;Derek W.

In this paper, we propose the use of textual narratives as a data-driven storytelling method to augment causality visualization. We first propose a design space for how textual narratives can be used to describe causal data. We then present results from a crowdsourced user study where participants were asked to recover causality information from two causality visualizations-causal graphs and Hasse diagrams-with and without an associated textual narrative. Finally, we describe Causeworks, a causality visualization system for understanding how specific interventions influence a causal model. The system incorporates an automatic textual narrative mechanism based on our design space.

In visualization, the term map-like describes techniques that incorporate characteristics of cartographic maps in their representation of abstract data. However, the field of map-like visualization is vast and currently lacks a clear classification of the existing techniques. Moreover, choosing the right technique to support a particular visualization task is further complicated, as techniques are scattered across different domains, with each considering different characteristics as map-like. In this paper, we give an overview of the literature on map-like visualization and provide a hierarchical classification of existing techniques along two general perspectives: imitation and schematization of cartographic maps. Each perspective is further divided into four principal categories that group common map-like techniques along the visual primitives they affect. We further discuss this classification from a task-centered view and highlight open research questions.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14031", "refList": ["10.1111/j.0020-2754.1998.00269.x.21", "10.1109/iv.2005.26", "10.2307/2980460", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2743959", "10.1016/j.jvlc.2011.11.004", "10.1145/2501988.2502046", "10.1559/1523040042742402", "10.1007/s00779-011-0500-3", "10.1111/cgf.12932", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.89", "10.1111/cgf.13200", "10.1080/15230406.2016.1160797", "10.1179/000870410x12825500202896", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70596", "10.5167/80972.19uzh-80972", "10.1007/978-3-319-11593-1\\_2", "10.1037/aca0000175", "10.1080/17538947.2014.923942", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467321", "10.1109/vissof.2005.1684299", "10.1559/152304098782383034", "10.1007/978-3-642-36763-2\\_38", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.130", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346274", "10.1111/cgf.12648", "10.1111/0004-5608.00242", "10.1177/1473871617724212", "10.1109/iv.2004.1320123", "10.1371/journal.pcbi.1006907", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599030", "10.1559/1523040042742411", "10.3390/informatics5030031", "10.1111/cgf.13079", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467811", "10.1016/j.tics.2003.12.004", "10.1007/s00799-016-0168-4", "10.1109/infvis.2004.57", "10.1007/s10021-007-9038-7", "10.1109/pacificvis.2015.7156366", "10.1007/978-3-319-27261-0\\_1", "10.1007/978-1-4471-2804-5\\_6", "10.1109/access.2019.2939977", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2747545", "10.1109/icdm.2003.1250978", "10.1111/cgf.13167", "10.1016/0010-0285(78)90006-3", "10.3138/nj8v-8514-871t-221k", "10.1016/j.cag.2009.06.002", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01937.x", "10.1016/b978-044451020-4/50035-9", "10.1111/1467-8659.00566", "10.5220/0006618101080119", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183571", "10.1145/2038558.2038579", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.191", "10.1111/j.0033-0124.1985.00075.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2004.1260761", "10.1007/978-3-642-34848-8\\_6", "10.1145/2968220.2968239", "10.1145/3002151.3002160", "10.1109/tst.2013.6509098", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.91", "10.1177/1473871615597077", "10.1016/j.jvlc.2011.02.001", "10.1080/17445647.2014.935502", "10.1177/1687814017740710", "10.1111/1744-7917.12601", "10.1073/pnas.0400280101", "10.1111/cgf.13672", "10.1109/mcg.2006.90", "10.1002/asi.21712", "10.1007/978-3-642-33024-7\\_3", "10.1145/2801040.2801056", "10.1109/mcg.2010.101", "10.1179/003962607x165041", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500039", "10.1109/vast.2016.7883510", "10.1559/152304009788988288", "10.1080/23729333.2017.1301346", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.66", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03085.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.288", "10.3390/ijgi9040253", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532150", "10.1145/2254556.2254636", "10.20382//jocg.v4i1a9", "10.1016/0010-0285(81)90016-5", "10.1145/2556288.2557224", "10.1109/iv.2001.942043", "10.1021/ed1000203", "10.1016/0169-7439(87)80084-9", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.154", "10.1016/j.jvlc.2015.10.003", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2903945", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.120", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934263", "10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-102209-144718", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.165", "10.3138/a477-3202-7876-n514", "10.1080/23729333.2017.1288535", "10.1111/j.0020-2754.1998.00269.x", "10.1109/mcg.2004.41", "10.1109/vast.2009.5332593", "10.1002/smr.414", "10.1007/s12650-019-00584-3", "10.1145/22949.22950", "10.1179/1743277413y.0000000036", "10.1080/15230406.2016.1262280", "10.1016/s0341-8162(01)00164-3", "10.22224/gistbok/2017.3.8", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.155", "10.1057/ivs.2008.31", "10.1016/j.cag.2004.03.012", "10.1179/1743277412y.0000000007", "10.1016/j.soncn.2011.02.001", "10.1179/caj.1987.24.1.27", "10.3138/carto.48.3.1691", "10.5220/0004267205150524", "10.1109/38.974518", "10.1145/102377.115768", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500186", "10.1109/5.58325", "10.5167/80972.uzh-80972", "10.1177/030913339602000204", "10.1007/978-3-642-22300-6\\_14", "10.1109/iv.2004.1320189", "10.1111/cgf.13447", "10.1007/s11192-017-2596-3", "10.1559/1523040053722150", "10.1007/978-3-662-45803-7\\_34"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 11}], "len": 63}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934243", "title": "CourtTime: Generating Actionable Insights into Tennis Matches Using Visual Analytics", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Tom Polk;Dominik J\u00e4ckle;Johannes H\u00e4ussler;Jing Yang", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Polk, T (Corresponding Author), Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany.

In this paper, we propose the use of textual narratives as a data-driven storytelling method to augment causality visualization. We first propose a design space for how textual narratives can be used to describe causal data. We then present results from a crowdsourced user study where participants were asked to recover causality information from two causality visualizations-causal graphs and Hasse diagrams-with and without an associated textual narrative. Finally, we describe Causeworks, a causality visualization system for understanding how specific interventions influence a causal model. The system incorporates an automatic textual narrative mechanism based on our design space.

However, adequately simulating the complex competition process and effectively explaining the simulation result to domain experts are typically challenging. This work presents a design study to address these challenges in table tennis. We propose a well-established hybrid second-order Markov chain model to characterize and simulate the competition process in table tennis. Compared with existing methods, our approach is the first to support the effective simulation of tactics, which represent high-level competition strategies in table tennis. Furthermore, we introduce a visual analytics system called Tac-Simur based on the proposed model for simulative visual analytics. Tac-Simur enables users to easily navigate different players and their tactics based on their respective performance in matches to identify the player and the tactics of interest for further analysis. Then, users can utilize the system to interactively explore diverse simulation tasks and visually explain the simulation results.

Trajectories in sports, such as the movement of players and balls, contain rich information on player behavior and thus have been widely analyzed by coaches and analysts to improve the players' performance. However, existing visual analytics systems often present the trajectories in court diagrams that are abstractions of reality, thereby causing difficulty for the experts to imagine the situation on the court and understand why the player acted in a certain way. With recent developments in immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), experts gradually have the opportunity to see, feel, explore, and understand these 3D trajectories from the player's perspective. Yet, few research has studied how to support immersive analysis of sports data from such a perspective. Specific challenges are rooted in data presentation (e.g., how to seamlessly combine 2D and 3D visualizations) and interaction (e.g., how to naturally interact with data without keyboard and mouse) in VR. To address these challenges, we have worked closely with domain experts who have worked for a top national badminton team to design ShuttleSpace. Our system leverages 1) the peripheral vision to combine the 2D and 3D visualizations and 2) the VR controller to support natural interactions via a stroke metaphor.

In this context, we present a study on how player actions may be clearly depicted on 2D diagrams. The study is focused on Baseball plays, a sport where diagrams are heavily used to summarize the actions of the players. We propose a new and simple approach to represent spatiotemporal information in the form of a timeline. We designed our visualization with a requirement driven approach, conducting interviews and fulfilling the needs of baseball experts and expert-fans. We validate our approach by presenting a detailed analysis of baseball plays and conducting interviews with four domain experts.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13436", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2012.225", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.192", "10.1109/visual.2001.964496", "10.1111/cgf.13189", "10.1109/mcg.2016.102", "10.1109/mcg.2016.101", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.263", "10.1109/mcg.2016.124", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500178", "10.1111/j.1435-5597.1970.tb01464.x", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042478", "10.1515/jqas-2014-0089", "10.1007/s13218-012-0177-4"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934243", "title": "CourtTime: Generating Actionable Insights into Tennis Matches Using Visual Analytics", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Tom Polk;Dominik J\u00e4ckle;Johannes H\u00e4ussler;Jing Yang", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Polk, T (Corresponding Author), Univ Konstanz, Constance, Germany.

To fully utilize this spatio-temporal data, we need to integrate it with domain-relevant context meta-data.

Our visual approach introduces a novel visual metaphor, namely 1\u2013D Space-Time Charts that enable the analysis of single points at a glance based on small multiples. We also employ user-driven sorting and clustering techniques and a layout technique that aligns the last few shots in a point to facilitate shot pattern discovery.

Then, users can utilize the system to interactively explore diverse simulation tasks and visually explain the simulation results. The effectiveness and usefulness of this work are demonstrated by two case studies, in which domain experts utilize Tac-Simur to find interesting and valuable insights.

However, these ranking algorithms have a variety of sensitivities, and even small changes in rank can lead to vast reductions in product sales and page hits.

Sports data visualization research encompasses the breadth of visualization tasks and goals: exploring the design of new visualization techniques; adapting existing visualizations to a novel domain; and conducting design studies and evaluations in close collaboration with experts, including practitioners, enthusiasts, and journalists. Frequently this research has impact beyond sports in both academia and in industry because it is i) grounded in realistic, highly heterogeneous data, ii) applied to real-world problems, and iii) designed in close collaboration with domain experts. In this report, we analyze current research contributions through the lens of three categories of sports data: box score data (data containing statistical summaries of a sport event such as a game), tracking data (data about in-game actions and trajectories), and meta-data (data about the sport and its participants but not necessarily a given game). We conclude this report with a high-level discussion of sports visualization research informed by our analysisidentifying critical research gaps and valuable opportunities for the visualization community.

We propose a well-established hybrid second-order Markov chain model to characterize and simulate the competition process in table tennis. Compared with existing methods, our approach is the first to support the effective simulation of tactics, which represent high-level competition strategies in table tennis. Furthermore, we introduce a visual analytics system called Tac-Simur based on the proposed model for simulative visual analytics. Tac-Simur enables users to easily navigate different players and their tactics based on their respective performance in matches to identify the player and the tactics of interest for further analysis. Then, users can utilize the system to interactively explore diverse simulation tasks and visually explain the simulation results. The effectiveness and usefulness of this work are demonstrated by two case studies, in which domain experts utilize Tac-Simur to find interesting and valuable insights. The domain experts also provide positive feedback on the usability of Tac-Simur.

For example, what items shall we recommend to a given user on an e-commerce platform? The answers to such questions are typically returned in the form of a ranked list, and graph-based ranking methods are widely used in industrial information retrieval settings. However, these ranking algorithms have a variety of sensitivities, and even small changes in rank can lead to vast reductions in product sales and page hits. As such, there is a need for tools and methods that can help model developers and analysts explore the sensitivities of graph ranking algorithms with respect to perturbations within the graph structure. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework for explaining and exploring the sensitivity of any graph-based ranking algorithm by performing perturbation-based what-if analysis. We demonstrate our framework through three case studies inspecting the sensitivity of two classic graph-based ranking algorithms (PageRank and HITS) as applied to rankings in political news media and social networks.", "keywords": "Graph-based ranking,sensitivity analysis,visual analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028958", "refList": ["10.1109/wsc.2017.8247800", "10.1023/a:1022649401552", "10.1515/1559-0410.11416", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598919", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934630", "10.1140/epjds29", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934670", "10.1016/j.eswa.2015.09.004", "10.1145/2702123.2702509", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.12.001", "10.2307/3002000", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934399", "10.1007/s41060-016-0032-z", "10.1111/cgf.13198", "10.14778/2350229.2350254", "10.1145/2939672.2939764", "10.1016/j.visinf.2017.01.006", "10.1145/2858036.2858529", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585647", "10.1007/bf01187020", "10.1109/icdm.2015.26", "10.1145/2362383.2362387", "10.1177/0049124104268644", "10.1109/vast.2011.6102442", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249025", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864475", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70528", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467691", "10.1111/cgf.13210", "10.1214/aos/1176344136", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2424872", "10.1016/j.visinf.2018.09.001", "10.1177/089443939100900106", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467931", "10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735", "10.1007/s11162-011-9241-4", "10.1111/cgf.13680", "10.1145/3065386", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864889", "10.1177/003804070808100402", "10.1109/icdm.2010.62", "10.1038/s41598-020-59669-x", "10.1162/153244303321897717", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934619", "10.1007/bf00356088", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598432", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030358", "title": "Once Upon A Time In Visualization: Understanding the Use of Textual Narratives for Causality", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Arjun Choudhry;Mandar Sharma;Pramod Chundury;Thomas Kapler;Derek W.

However, as the scale and complexity of these event sequences grows, even these visualizations can become overwhelming to use. In this paper, we propose the use of textual narratives as a data-driven storytelling method to augment causality visualization. We first propose a design space for how textual narratives can be used to describe causal data. We then present results from a crowdsourced user study where participants were asked to recover causality information from two causality visualizations-causal graphs and Hasse diagrams-with and without an associated textual narrative. Finally, we describe Causeworks, a causality visualization system for understanding how specific interventions influence a causal model. The system incorporates an automatic textual narrative mechanism based on our design space. We validate Causeworks through interviews with experts who used the system for understanding complex events.", "keywords": "Causality visualization,natural language generation,data-driven storytelling,temporal data,quantitative studies", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030358", "refList": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0171156", "10.1007/s11424-013-2290-3", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934630", "10.1515/hukin-2015-0013", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745181", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03118.x", "10.1007/s10618-017-0513-2", "10.1371/journal.pone.0029638", "10.1016/j.visinf.2019.10.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.192", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744218", "10.1590/s1980-65742014000300004", "10.1186/1471-2105-16-s13-s8", "10.1109/mcg.2016.124", "10.1109/tmm.2016.2614221", "10.1145/3219819.3219832", "10.1007/s11424-013-2291-2", "10.1198/016214506000000302", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934243", "10.1109/iv.2011.57", "10.1111/cgf.13189", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865041", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042477", "10.1177/1473871613511959", "10.1109/iv.2010.39", "10.3390/ijgi4042159", "10.1111/cgf.13436", "10.1016/j.visinf.2017.01.005", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346445"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13965", "year": "2020", "title": "Bombalytics: Visualization of Competition and Collaboration Strategies of Players in a Bomb Laying Game", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Shivam Agarwal;G{\\\"{u}}nter Wallner;Fabian Beck", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Agarwal, S (Corresponding Author), Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany.\nAgarwal, Shivam; Beck, Fabian, Univ Duisburg Essen, Duisburg, Germany.\nWallner, Gunter, Eindhoven Univ Technol, Eindhoven, Netherlands.\nWallner, Gunter, Univ Appl Arts Vienna, Vienna, Austria.", "countries": "Germany;Austria;Netherlands", "abstract": "Competition and collaboration form complex interaction patterns between the agents and objects involved.

Moreover, choosing the right technique to support a particular visualization task is further complicated, as techniques are scattered across different domains, with each considering different characteristics as map-like. In this paper, we give an overview of the literature on map-like visualization and provide a hierarchical classification of existing techniques along two general perspectives: imitation and schematization of cartographic maps.
