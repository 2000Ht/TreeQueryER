First and foremost, this ability depends on perceptual discriminability; observers must be able to see the difference between different colors for those colors to communicate different meanings. However, the ability to interpret visualizations also depends on semantic discriminability, the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts, based on the visual features and concepts alone (i.e., without help from verbal cues such as legends or labels). Previous evidence suggested that observers were better at interpreting encoding systems that maximized semantic discriminability (maximizing association strength between assigned colors and concepts while minimizing association strength between unassigned colors and concepts), compared to a system that only maximized color-concept association strength. However, increasing semantic discriminability also resulted in increased perceptual distance, so it is unclear which factor was responsible for improved performance. In the present study, we conducted two experiments that tested for independent effects of semantic distance and perceptual distance on semantic discriminability of bar graph data visualizations. Perceptual distance was large enough to ensure colors were more than just noticeably different. We found that increasing semantic distance improved performance, independent of variation in perceptual distance, and when these two factors were uncorrelated, responses were dominated by semantic distance. These results have implications for navigating trade-offs in color palette design optimization for visual communication.", "keywords": "Visual Reasoning,Information Visualization,Visual Communication,Visual Encoding,Color Perception,Color Cognition", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030434", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2012.233", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744359", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598918", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467471", "10.1016/b978-0-08-042415-6.50014-4", "10.1146/annurev-psych-120710-100504", "10.1080/13875868.2015.1137577", "10.1109/visual.1996.568118", "10.1006/ijhc.1017", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346983", "10.1145/2254556.2254572", "10.3758/bf03201236", "10.2307/2981473", "10.1037/0033-2909.114.3.510", "10.1111/cgf.12127", "10.1002/nav.3800020109", "10.1145/3025453.3026041", "10.1111/j.1756-8765.2011.01150.x", "10.1016/0010-0285(80)90005-5", "10.1207/s15516709cog1003\\_2", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934536", "10.1186/s41235-018-0090-y", "10.1023/a:1013180410169", "10.1038/s41562-017-0058", "10.20982/tqmp.01.1.p042", "10.1137/0105003", "10.1559/152304089783813918", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865147", "10.1179/000870403235002042", "10.1179/caj.1968.5.1.54"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1081, "embedding": [-0.7110669612884521, 0.17595037817955017, -1.060706377029419, -1.7272028923034668, -0.6745967864990234, 0.16650904715061188, 3.0588741302490234, 1.386406421661377, -0.43282294273376465, 0.2734566032886505, -0.8100081086158752, -0.4484059810638428, -0.13324885070323944, 0.11504492163658142, 0.5018446445465088, 1.0625653266906738, -0.17821377515792847, 0.08175134658813477, -0.650787889957428, -0.6788274645805359, -0.06630208343267441, 1.0392613410949707, -0.8351743817329407, -0.12925946712493896, -1.452265739440918, 0.09129026532173157, -0.5500518083572388, -0.16255053877830505, 0.5947602391242981, 0.8930822610855103, -0.949406087398529, 0.11334316432476044], "projection": [-3.8488833904266357, -2.9986631870269775], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
