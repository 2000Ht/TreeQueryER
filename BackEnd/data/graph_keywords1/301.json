The high-order access dependencies are defined as transition probabilities from one data block to other blocks based on a few historical data accesses. Compared with existing methods which employed first-order access dependencies, our approach takes the advantages of high order access dependencies with higher accuracy and reliability in data access prediction. In our work, high-order access dependencies are calculated by tracing densely-seeded pathlines. The efficiency of our proposed approach is demonstrated through a parallel particle tracing framework with high-order data prefetching. Results show that our method can achieve higher data locality than the first-order access dependencies based method, thereby reducing the I/O requests and improving the efficiency of pathline computation in various applications.", "keywords": "", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/SciVis.2015.7429515", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346418", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183585"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 301, "embedding": [-2.125394344329834, -0.2801166772842407, -1.030107021331787, -0.26406028866767883, -0.11488457024097443, 0.16650904715061188, 5.349244117736816, 1.7859841585159302, 7.809534549713135, -0.7817944884300232, 2.9005770683288574, -0.9841079115867615, 0.009662487544119358, 2.173267364501953, -0.804432213306427, -0.5232402086257935, -0.008738257922232151, 0.07072390615940094, -0.23242419958114624, 0.03240932896733284, -0.06630208343267441, 0.5226964354515076, -0.05622868984937668, -0.1390654742717743, -1.164926290512085, 2.3710732460021973, -0.5452967882156372, -0.19688554108142853, -0.5651506185531616, -2.657630681991577, 0.3318488895893097, -0.9189074635505676], "projection": [14.69176959991455, 4.3798394203186035], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
