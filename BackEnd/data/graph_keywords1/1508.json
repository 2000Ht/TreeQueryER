In this paper, we consider second-order symmetric tensors with uncertainty. In the 3D case, this means the tensor data consists of 6 coefficients - uncertainty, however, is encoded by 21 coefficients assuming a multivariate Gaussian distribution as model. The high dimension makes the direct visualization of tensor data with uncertainty a difficult problem, which was until now unsolved. The contribution of this paper consists in the design of glyphs for uncertain second-order symmetric tensors in 2D and 3D. The construction consists of a standard glyph for the mean tensor that is augmented by a scalar field that represents uncertainty. We show that this scalar field and therefore the displayed glyph encode the uncertainty comprehensively, i.e., there exists a bijective map between the glyph and the parameters of the distribution. Our approach can extend several classes of existing glyphs for symmetric tensors to additionally encode uncertainty and therefore provides a possible foundation for further uncertain tensor glyph design. For demonstration, we choose the well-known superquadric glyphs, and we show that the uncertainty visualization satisfies all their design constraints.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13692", "refList": ["10.1007/978-1-4471-2804-5\\_6", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598998", "10.1111/cgf.12357", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346455", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.199", "10.1109/tmi.2003.815059", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467435", "10.1111/cgf.13173", "10.1002/mrm.10331", "10.1111/cgf.12099", "10.1111/cgf.12890", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467031", "10.1016/j.sigpro.2006.02.050", "10.1007/978-1-4471-6497-5\\_1", "10.2312/vissym/vissym04/147-154", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183591"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1508, "embedding": [-2.1405532360076904, -0.30501702427864075, -1.0404996871948242, -0.3397044837474823, -0.15341229736804962, 0.16650904715061188, 4.232699394226074, 1.594744086265564, 6.664301872253418, -0.734541118144989, 2.690857410430908, -1.096014142036438, 0.05267440527677536, 2.031601905822754, -0.99098140001297, -0.5263585448265076, -0.1782408505678177, 0.06877747178077698, -0.3328309655189514, 0.07801923155784607, -0.06630208343267441, 0.5523685812950134, -0.18430595099925995, -0.1691095381975174, -1.166448950767517, 2.8945698738098145, -0.5834015607833862, -0.21145495772361755, -0.5749752521514893, -2.775730609893799, 0.1861349195241928, -0.9660730957984924], "projection": [3.3848164081573486, 25.16025161743164], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
