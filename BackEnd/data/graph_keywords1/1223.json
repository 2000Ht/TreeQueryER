A variety of sampling strategies have been proposed to reduce overdraw and visual clutter with the spatial densities of points taken into account. However, informative attributes associated with the points also play significant roles in the exploration of geographical datasets. In this paper, we propose an attribute-based abstraction method to simplify the cluttered visualization of large-scale geographical points. Spatial autocorrelations are utilized to measure the attribute relationships of points in local areas, and a novel attribute-based sampling model is designed to generate a subset of points to preserve both density and attribute characteristics of original geographical points. A set of visual designs and user-friendly interactions are implemented, enabling users to capture the spatial distribution of geographical points and get deeper insights into the attribute features across local areas. Case studies and quantitative comparisons based on the real-world datasets further demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the abstraction and exploration of large-scale geographical point datasets.", "keywords": "Visual Abstraction,Spatial Autocorrelation,Sampling,Geospatial Analysis", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00011", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2008.119,10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598862,10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346594,10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934541,10.1109/tvcg.2006.161,10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934670,10.1109/tvcg.2008.175,10.1109/tvcg.2007.70535,10.1109/tvcg.2010.176,10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934799,10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598432,10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831,10.1109/tvcg.2006.170,10.1109/tvcg.2010.180,10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346265,10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346746,10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934208,10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744098,10.1109/vast47406.2019.8986943,10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865020,10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864503"], "wos": 0, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1223, "embedding": [-1.0615344047546387, 0.3345714509487152, -1.059349536895752, -1.570709466934204, -0.6495316028594971, 0.16650904715061188, 1.7870428562164307, 1.8466192483901978, -0.4013857841491699, -0.07265567034482956, -0.8557025790214539, -0.48163366317749023, -0.1336275339126587, -0.3038485050201416, 0.5910453200340271, 0.9868698716163635, -0.20203587412834167, 0.07991757988929749, -0.659038782119751, -0.09194373339414597, -0.06630208343267441, 1.6731168031692505, -0.8838748335838318, -0.10142243653535843, -1.9878417253494263, 0.09441477060317993, -0.5399249196052551, -0.1705622375011444, 0.7485114932060242, 0.5138406753540039, -0.6837469339370728, 0.23742297291755676], "projection": [-4.059388637542725, -1.9699875116348267], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
