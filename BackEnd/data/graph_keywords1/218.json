For synchronous co-located collaboration, a well-recognized challenge is to deliver different contents to people with different privileges and different responsibilities. This challenge is becoming more obvious with the use of a shared display space such as a wall-size display. In particular, scenarios often arise that a privileged participant needs to access sensitive information that other participants are not permitted to view. This is nearly impossible to achieve with only a single display. As a result, it becomes clear that additional devices are needed to provide some of the participants the capability to access and manage certain information in a private space. In this work, we investigate incorporating optical see-through head-mounted displays (OST-HMDs) with a wall-size display to deliver sensitive information in a synchronous co-located, collaborative setting. With our prototype system, we conduct a user study to observe the collaboration styles under this unique setup. We also present the lessons learned by reflecting on the iterative design process of our prototype system.", "keywords": "Augmented reality; collaborative visual analysis; head-mounted display; privacy; synchronous co-located collaboration; wall-size display", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis.2019.00010", "refList": ["10.1016/j.cag.2007.01.029", "10.1145/3025453.3025594", "10.1109/ismar.2010.5643559", "10.1109/2.291294", "10.1145/3173574.3173593", "10.1145/2702123.2702129", "10.1109/ismar.2004.23", "10.1109/vast.2016.7883506", "10.1145/3131277.3132173", "10.1002/(sici)1096-9128(199809/11)10:11/13", "10.1109/immersive.2016.7932374", "10.4108/icst.collaboratecom.2014.257337", "10.1145/2576099", "10.1145/2207676.2208691", "10.1109/38.689665", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599107", "10.1145/3173574.3173664", "10.1145/2557500.2557541", "10.1145/3009939.3009945", "10.1145/7885.7887", "10.1162/105474602317343640", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2592906", "10.1007/bf01409796", "10.1111/cgf.13206", "10.1166/jnn.2014.9101", "10.1145/293701.293740", "10.1109/iwar.1999.803809", "10.1145/2702123.2702406", "10.1177/1473871611415997", "10.1109/hicss.2013.420", "10.1007/978-3-662-04232-8\\_2"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030460", "title": "Personal Augmented Reality for Information Visualization on Large Interactive Displays", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Patrick Reipschl\u00e4ger;Tamara Flemisch;Raimund Dachselt", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Reipschlager, P (Corresponding Author), Tech Univ Dresden, Interact Media Lab, Dresden, Germany.

Even though large displays provide more display space, they are challenging with regard to perception, effective multi-user support, and managing data density and complexity. To address these issues and illustrate our proposed setup, we contribute an extensive design space comprising first, the spatial alignment of display, visualizations, and objects in AR space. Next, we discuss which parts of a visualization can be augmented. Finally, we analyze how AR can be used to display personal views in order to show additional information and to minimize the mutual disturbance of data analysts. Based on this conceptual foundation, we present a number of exemplary techniques for extending visualizations with AR and discuss their relation to our design space. We further describe how these techniques address typical visualization problems that we have identified during our literature research. To examine our concepts, we introduce a generic AR visualization framework as well as a prototype implementing several example techniques. In order to demonstrate their potential, we further present a use case walkthrough in which we analyze a movie data set. From these experiences, we conclude that the contributed techniques can be useful in exploring and understanding multivariate data.

However, most prior studies of collaborative immersive analytics have focused on how groups interact with surface interfaces such as tabletops and wall displays. This paper reports on a study in which teams of three co-located participants are given flexible visualisation authoring tools to allow a great deal of control in how they structure their shared workspace. They do so using a prototype system we call FIESTA: the Free-roaming Immersive Environment to Support Team-based Analysis. Unlike traditional visualisation tools, FIESTA allows users to freely position authoring interfaces and visualisation artefacts anywhere in the virtual environment, either on virtual surfaces or suspended within the interaction space. Our participants solved visual analytics tasks on a multivariate data set, doing so individually and collaboratively by creating a large number of 2D and 3D visualisations. Their behaviours suggest that the usage of surfaces is coupled with the type of visualisation used, often using walls to organise 2D visualisations, but positioning 3D visualisations in the space around them. Outside of tightly-coupled collaboration, participants followed social protocols and did not interact with visualisations that did not belong to them even if outside of its owner's personal workspace.", "keywords": "Immersive analytics,collaboration,virtual reality,qualitative study,multivariate data", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030450", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2008.153", "10.1007/s10606-004-5062-8", "10.1145/3343055.3359718", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00010", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2914677", "10.1016/0020-7373(91)90039-a", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.287", "10.1117/12.2005484", "10.1109/mmul.2009.35", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934803", "10.1145/3359996.3364242", "10.1109/immersive.2016.7932384", "10.1016/j.future.2008.07.015", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500167", "10.1109/mcg.2019.2898941", "10.1145/3343055.3360746", "10.1007/978-3-319-45853-3\\_8", "10.1145/2576099", "10.1145/2858036.2858039", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599107", "10.1145/3173574.3173664", "10.1007/978-3-030-01388-2\\_2", "10.1109/vr.2019.8797978", "10.1145/3126594.3126613", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2592906", "10.1109/mcg.2019.2898856", "10.1007/978-3-030-01388-2\\_8", "10.1023/a:1021271517844", "10.1109/bigdata.2014.7004282", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934395", "10.1109/ismar.2010.5643530", "10.1007/978-3-030-01388-22", "10.1145/2133806.2133821", "10.1109/3dvis.2014.7160093", "10.1145/2556288.2557058", "10.1109/vr.2019.8797845"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030334", "title": "Uplift: A Tangible and Immersive Tabletop System for Casual Collaborative Visual Analytics", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Barrett Ens;Sarah Goodwin;Arnaud Prouzeau;Fraser Anderson;Florence Y.

These processes are typically imagined as formalised, extended activities, between groups of dedicated experts, requiring expertise with sophisticated data analysis tools. However, there are many professional domains that benefit from support for short 'bursts' of data exploration between a subset of stakeholders with a diverse breadth of knowledge. Such 'casual collaborative\u2019 scenarios will require engaging features to draw users' attention, with intuitive, 'walk-up and use\u2019 interfaces. This paper presents Uplift, a novel prototype system to support 'casual collaborative visual analytics' for a campus microgrid, co-designed with local stakeholders. An elicitation workshop with key members of the building management team revealed relevant knowledge is distributed among multiple experts in their team, each using bespoke analysis tools. Uplift combines an engaging 3D model on a central tabletop display with intuitive tangible interaction, as well as augmented-reality, mid-air data visualisation, in order to support casual collaborative visual analytics for this complex domain. Evaluations with expert stakeholders from the building management and energy domains were conducted during and following our prototype development and indicate that Uplift is successful as an engaging backdrop for casual collaboration. Experts see high potential in such a system to bring together diverse knowledge holders and reveal complex interactions between structural, operational, and financial aspects of their domain.
