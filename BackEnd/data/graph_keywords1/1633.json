When exploring the resulting large trajectory collections, visual summaries are a useful tool to identify time intervals of interest. A typical approach is to represent the spatial positions of the tracked objects at each time step via a one-dimensional ordering; visualizations of such orderings can then be placed in temporal order along a time line.\nThere are two main criteria to assess the quality of the resulting visual summary: spatial quality -- how well does the ordering capture the structure of the data at each time step, and stability -- how coherent are the orderings over consecutive time steps or temporal ranges? In this paper we introduce a new Stable Principal Component (SPC) method to compute such orderings, which is explicitly parameterized for stability, allowing a trade-off between the spatial quality and stability. We conduct extensive computational experiments that quantitatively compare the orderings produced by ours and other stable dimensionality-reduction methods to various state-of-the-art approaches using a set of well-established quality metrics that capture spatial quality and stability. We conclude that stable dimensionality reduction outperforms existing methods on stability, without sacrificing spatial quality or efficiency; in particular, our new SPC method does so at a fraction of the computational costs.", "doi": "stablevisualsummarie-2021", "year": 2021, "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "citationCount": 0, "keywords": "", "link": "", "refList": "", "wos": 0, "len": 1}, "index": 1633, "embedding": [-1.9697543382644653, -0.24827826023101807, -1.0626764297485352, -0.3133954405784607, -0.20304404199123383, 0.16650904715061188, 5.487421035766602, 1.4839154481887817, 6.381003379821777, -0.5729827284812927, 2.02614426612854, -0.9405134320259094, 0.19541630148887634, 2.248530626296997, -0.6561029553413391, -0.5703742504119873, -0.08084333688020706, 0.07420150190591812, -0.22253474593162537, 0.5700315833091736, -0.06630208343267441, 0.602672278881073, -0.10324677079916, -0.13057257235050201, -1.3603376150131226, 2.6052417755126953, -0.5483691096305847, -0.1611158847808838, -0.529516339302063, -2.4690706729888916, 0.27074241638183594, -0.9136355519294739], "projection": [8.985513687133789, -12.891090393066406], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
