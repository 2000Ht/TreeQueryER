As a result, scrollytelling has been mainly used only by professional journalists to disseminate opinions. In this paper, we present an automatic method to generate expressive scrollytelling visualization, which can present easy-to-understand data facts through a carefully arranged sequence of views. The method first enumerates data facts of a given dataset and scores and organizes them. The facts are further assembled, sequenced into a story, with reader input taken into consideration. Finally, visual graphs, transitions, and text descriptions are generated to synthesize the scrollytelling visualization. In this way, non-professionals can easily explore and share interesting perspectives from selected data attributes and fact types. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of our method through both use cases and an in-lab user study.", "doi": "automaticgenerationo-2021", "year": 2021, "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "citationCount": 0, "keywords": "", "link": "", "refList": "", "wos": 0, "len": 1}, "index": 1615, "embedding": [-1.9854819774627686, -0.2614552974700928, -1.03950035572052, -0.22114413976669312, -0.11444863677024841, 0.16650904715061188, 5.706880569458008, 1.7009357213974, 7.18064022064209, -0.6802392601966858, 2.425419807434082, -0.8929865956306458, 0.05484810844063759, 2.1093215942382812, -0.7128351926803589, -0.5202935338020325, 0.012518618255853653, 0.06584581732749939, -0.17983613908290863, 0.03868870064616203, -0.06630208343267441, 0.4564744532108307, -0.13968026638031006, -0.12045589834451675, -1.1831179857254028, 2.221646785736084, -0.4969606399536133, -0.16244997084140778, -0.5392300486564636, -2.6684696674346924, 0.2814798355102539, -0.8738863468170166], "projection": [14.697192192077637, 4.385196685791016], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
