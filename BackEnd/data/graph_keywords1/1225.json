During economic slowdowns, corporate default may spread like a virus and lead to large-scale defaults or even systemic financial crises. To help financial regulatory authorities and banks manage the risk associated with networked loans, we identified the default contagion risk, a pivotal issue in developing preventive measures, and established iConViz, an interactive visual analysis tool that facilitates the closed-loop analysis process. A novel financial metric, the contagion effect, was formulated to quantify the infectious consequences of guarantee chains in this type of network. Based on this metric, we designed and implemented a series of novel and coordinated views that address the analysis of financial problems. Experts evaluated the system using real-world financial data. The proposed approach grants practitioners the ability to avoid previous ad hoc analysis methodologies and extend coverage of the conventional Capital Accord to the banking industry.", "keywords": "Visualization analytics,Regulatory visualization", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00013", "refList": ["10.1109/vast.2007.4389009,10.1109/vast.2008.4677360,10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744758,10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864814"], "wos": 0, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1225, "embedding": [-1.3664989471435547, 0.5701100826263428, -1.0434188842773438, -1.5431197881698608, -0.6721880435943604, 0.16650904715061188, 1.575150728225708, 1.5498906373977661, -0.45468848943710327, 0.12662380933761597, -1.2257416248321533, -0.5195469260215759, -0.15996834635734558, 0.18722645938396454, 0.9289003014564514, 1.1478495597839355, -0.24351109564304352, 0.6170645356178284, -0.7097932696342468, -0.15526188910007477, -0.06630208343267441, 2.3091647624969482, -0.5642666220664978, 0.28425246477127075, -1.7640314102172852, 0.061810001730918884, -0.5581337213516235, 0.29488828778266907, 1.0411596298217773, -0.7760034203529358, -0.7214300632476807, 0.5686267018318176], "projection": [-4.387475967407227, -0.41032466292381287], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
