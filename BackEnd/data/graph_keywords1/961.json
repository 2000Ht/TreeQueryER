Nothelfer, Christine; Franconeri, Steven, Northwestern Univ, Evanston, IL 60208 USA.", "countries": "USA", "abstract": "The power of data visualization is not to convey absolute values of individual data points, but to allow the exploration of relations (increases or decreases in a data value) among them. One approach to highlighting these relations is to explicitly encode the numeric differences (deltas) between data values. Because this approach removes the context of the individual data values, it is important to measure how much of a performance improvement it actually offers, especially across differences in encodings and tasks, to ensure that it is worth adding to a visualization design. Across 3 different tasks, we measured the increase in visual processing efficiency for judging the relations between pairs of data values, from when only the values were shown, to when the deltas between the values were explicitly encoded, across position and length visual feature encodings (and slope encodings in Experiments 1 & 2). In Experiment 1, the participant's task was to locate a pair of data values with a given relation (e.g., Find the \u2018small bar to the left of a tall bar\u2019 pair) among pairs of the opposite relation, and we measured processing efficiency from the increase in response times as the number of pairs increased. In Experiment 2, the task was to judge which of two relation types was more prevalent in a briefly presented display of 10 data pairs (e.g., Are there more \u2018small bar to the left of a tall bar\u2019 pairs or more \u2018tall bar to the left of a small bar\u2019 pairs?). In the final experiment, the task was to estimate the average delta within a briefly presented display of 6 data pairs (e.g., What is the average bar height difference across all \u2018small bar to the left of a tall bar\u2019 pairs?). Across all three experiments, visual processing of relations between data value pairs was significantly better when directly encoded as deltas rather than implicitly between individual data points, and varied substantially depending on the task (improvement ranged from 25% to 95%). Considering the ubiquity of bar charts and dot plots, relation perception for individual data values is highly inefficient, and confirms the need for alternative designs that provide not only absolute values, but also direct encoding of critical relationships between those values.", "keywords": "Information visualization,marks,perception,attention,visual comparison,visual search,aggregation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934801", "refList": ["10.1145/230562.230563", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.127", "10.1163/156856897x00357", "10.1145/2993901.2993909", "10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00133-8", "10.1145/22949.22950", "10.1126/science.229.4716.828", "10.1037/0033-295x.95.1.15", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346320", "10.1093/acprof:osobl/9780199734337.003.0030", "10.1111/1467-9280.00327", "10.1016/j.cognition.2011.11.002", "10.1038/nrn1411", "10.1167/16.5.11", "10.1037/0096-1523.15.3.419", "10.2307/2288400", "10.1111/1467-9280.00006", "10.1037/0096-1523.20.5.1015", "10.1037/0096-1523.18.1.34", "10.1016/j.cognition.2004.06.006", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.183", "10.1080/13506280143000214"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3028891", "title": "A Structured Review of Data Management Technology for Interactive Visualization and Analysis", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Leilani Battle;Carlos Scheidegger", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Battle, L (Corresponding Author), Univ Maryland, Dept Comp Sci, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.

Concurrently to the contributions in data visualization, research in data management has produced technology that directly benefits interactive analysis. Here, we contribute a systematic review of 30 years of work in this adjacent field, and highlight techniques and principles we believe to be underappreciated in visualization work. We structure our review along two axes. First, we use task taxonomies from the visualization literature to structure the space of interactions in usual systems. Second, we created a categorization of data management work that strikes a balance between specificity and generality. Concretely, we contribute a characterization of 131 research papers along these two axes. We find that five notions in data management venues fit interactive visualization systems well: materialized views, approximate query processing, user modeling and query prediction, muiti-query optimization, lineage techniques, and indexing techniques. In addition, we find a preponderance of work in materialized views and approximate query processing, most targeting a limited subset of the interaction tasks in the taxonomy we used. This suggests natural avenues of future research both in visualization and data management. Our categorization both changes how we visualization researchers design and build our systems, and highlights where future work is necessary.", "keywords": "", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028891", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2012.233", "10.1016/s0022-5371(74)80015-0", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744359", "10.1037/0096-3445.136.4.623", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467732", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.196", "10.1037/a0029856", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346979", "10.1037/h0030300", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598918", "10.1109/beliv.2018.8634420", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864909", "10.1111/cgf.13079", "10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00355", "10.1145/2858036.2858465", "10.1080/01621459.1989.10478821", "10.1037/0278-7393.24.3.732", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.127", "10.1145/2858036.2858063", "10.4249/scholarpedia.3325", "10.4324/9781410611949", "10.1111/cgf.13444", "10.1145/2993901.2993909", "10.1037/0033-295x.96.2.267", "10.1006/ijhc.1017", "10.1086/405615", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934801", "10.1038/17953", "10.1037/xhp0000314", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934400", "10.1145/2470654.2470723", "10.1037/0096-1523.16.2.332", "10.1167/16.5.11", "10.3758/s13423-016-1174-7", "10.3758/bf03207704", "10.1146/annurev.psych.55.090902.141415", "10.2307/2288400", "10.3758/bf03204258", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.279", "10.1109/vissoft.2014.36", "10.3758/s13423-011-0055-3", "10.1145/3025453.3025922", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934284", "10.3758/bf03210498", "10.3758/bf03200774", "10.2307/1419876", "10.1038/s41562-017-0058", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.237", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183556", "10.1109/infvis.1997.636792", "10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198523192.003.0005", "10.1073/pnas.1117465109", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.234", "10.1038/nn.3655", "10.1111/cgf.12379", "10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044232", "10.1111/cgf.13695", "10.1037/0033-295x.107.3.500", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.183", "10.1146/annurev.psych.53.100901.135125", "10.1037//0022-3514.79.6.995", "10.1559/152304003100010929", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865147", "10.1037/0096-1523.18.3.849", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01694.x", "10.1145/3290605.3300771"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030419", "title": "Comparative Layouts Revisited: Design Space, Guidelines, and Future Directions", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Sehi L'Yi;Jaemin Jo;Jinwook Seo", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "L'Yi, S (Corresponding Author), Harvard Med Sch, Boston, MA 02115 USA.

For the last decade, these layouts have served as fundamental idioms in designing many visualization systems. However, we found that the layouts have been used with inconsistent terms and confusion, and the lessons from previous studies are fragmented. The goal of our research is to distill the results from previous studies into a consistent and reusable framework. We review 127 research papers, including 15 papers with quantitative user studies, which employed comparative layouts. We first alleviate the ambiguous boundaries in the design space of comparative layouts by suggesting lucid terminology (e.g., chart-wise and item-wise juxtaposition). We then identify the diverse aspects of comparative layouts, such as the advantages and concerns of using each layout in the real-world scenarios and researchers' approaches to overcome the concerns. Building our knowledge on top of the initial insights gained from the Gleicher et al.'s survey [19], we elaborate on relevant empirical evidence that we distilled from our survey (e.g., the actual effectiveness of the layouts in different study settings) and identify novel facets that the original work did not cover (e.g., the familiarity of the layouts to people). Finally, we show the consistent and contradictory results on the performance of comparative layouts and offer practical implications for using the layouts by suggesting trade-offs and seven actionable guidelines.", "keywords": "Comparative layout,visual comparison,literature review,juxtaposition,superposition,explicit-encoding", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030419", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2013.233", "10.1111/cgf.12380", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1145/2702123.2702419", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2322363", "10.1111/cgf.12791", "10.1145/2702123.2702130", "10.1145/2702123.2702217", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.237", "10.1177/1473871613480062", "10.1109/mcg.2017.377152546", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.213", "10.1111/cgf.12369", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744198", "10.1145/3139295.3139309", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934801", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.122", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2747545", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2413774", "10.1037/0096-1523.24.3.719", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346320", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70535", "10.1109/mcg.2018.032421661", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744199", "10.1145/2556288.2557141", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.149", "10.1145/1165734.1165736", "10.5220/0006127502170224", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745298", "10.1177/1473871617692841", "10.1190/int-2017-0083.1", "10.1190/int-2014-0283.1", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598796", "10.1111/cgf.13401", "10.1016/j.cag.2017.05.005", "10.1177/1473871616667632", "10.1145/3025453.3025882", "10.1145/2470654.2470724", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70539", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864884", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.164", "10.1145/3103010.3103013", "10.1109/pacificvis.2016.7465266", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183556", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467751", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2796557", "10.1111/cgf.13531", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.161", "10.1109/iv.2018.00051", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.162", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864510", "10.1109/iv.2017.30", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70623"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 5}, "index": 961, "embedding": [1.1627211570739746, 0.13561221957206726, -1.03950035572052, 2.0682992935180664, 0.10523433983325958, 0.16650904715061188, -0.3686386048793793, 1.0673916339874268, 0.596743643283844, 0.3634646236896515, 0.6914151906967163, 0.03578515350818634, -0.1268409788608551, 0.35417383909225464, -0.7128351926803589, 0.6451694369316101, -0.20178551971912384, 0.06584581732749939, -0.6218824982643127, 2.258430242538452, -0.06630208343267441, 0.5386472344398499, -0.15067413449287415, 0.35523688793182373, -0.701572597026825, 1.168816089630127, -0.4969606399536133, -0.16244997084140778, 1.1392093896865845, -1.2995805740356445, -0.42516762018203735, -0.18109367787837982], "projection": [-1.268410325050354, 7.046136379241943], "size": 3, "height": 2, "width": 2}
