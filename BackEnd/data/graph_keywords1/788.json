Text plays a major role in this activity since it represents the bulk of the clinical documentation, but reviewing it quickly becomes onerous when patient charts grow too large. Text visualization methods have been widely explored to manage this large scale through visual summaries that rely on information retrieval algorithms to structure text and make it amenable to visualization. However, the integration with such automated approaches comes with a number of limitations, including significant error rates and the need for healthcare providers to fine-tune algorithms without expert knowledge of their inner mechanics. In addition, several of these approaches obscure or substitute the original clinical text and therefore fail to leverage qualitative and rhetorical flavours of the clinical notes. These drawbacks have limited the adoption of text visualization and other summarization technologies in clinical practice. In this work we present Doccurate, a novel system embodying a curation-based approach for the visualization of large clinical text datasets. Our approach offers automation auditing and customizability to physicians while also preserving and extensively linking to the original text. We discuss findings of a formal qualitative evaluation conducted with 6 domain experts, shedding light onto physicians' information needs, perceived strengths and limitations of automated tools, and the importance of customization while balancing efficiency. We also present use case scenarios to showcase Doccurate's envisioned usage in practice.", "keywords": "Visual Curation,Clinical Text,Text Visualization,Medical Narrative", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864905", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744478", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467591", "10.1109/tkde.2014.2324581", "10.1093/jamia/ocv069", "10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002945", "10.1145/2089094.2089101", "10.1109/titb.2012.2186149", "10.1093/jamia/ocv032", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.129", "10.1145/2939672.2939778", "10.1136/jamia.2009.001560", "10.1016/j.cmpb.2015.10.014", "10.3122/jabfm.2011.06.100255", "10.1109/titb.2006.884365", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346677", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467531", "10.1016/0020-7101(96)01178-6", "10.1145/2531602.2531620", "10.1109/vast.2012.6400485", "10.1038/sdata.2016.35", "10.1016/s0140-6736(94)91406-0", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042502", "10.1561/1100000039", "10.1093/jamia/ocx070", "10.1145/3173574.3173996", "10.1109/infvis.2000.885098", "10.1145/1378773.1378785", "10.1093/bioinformatics/btx228"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "title": "Criteria for Rigor in Visualization Design Study", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Miriah D.

From this interpretivist position we explore the nature of visualization design study and develop six criteria for rigor. We propose that rigor is established and judged according to the extent to which visualization design study research and its reporting are INFORMED, REFLEXIVE, ABUNDANT, PLAUSIBLE, RESONANT, and TRANSPARENT. This perspective and the criteria were constructed through a four-year engagement with the discourse around rigor and the nature of knowledge in social science, information systems, and design. We suggest methods from cognate disciplines that can support visualization researchers in meeting these criteria during the planning, execution, and reporting of design study. Through a series of deliberately provocative questions, we explore implications of this new perspective for design study research in visualization, concluding that as a discipline, visualization is not yet well positioned to embrace, nurture, and fully benefit from a rigorous, interpretivist approach to design study.

Computational tools, such as dimensionality reduction (DR) and classification, are commonly used to efficiently process the multidimensional space of features.

To provide a solution for scrutinizing such complex data, we introduce ChemVA, an interactive application for the visual exploration of large molecular ensembles and their features. Our tool consists of multiple coordinated views: Hexagonal view, Detail view, 3D view, Table view, and a newly proposed Difference view designed for the comparison of DR projections. These views display DR projections combined with biological activity, selected molecular features, and confidence scores for each of these projections. This conjunction of views allows the user to drill down through the dataset and to efficiently select candidate compounds. Our approach was evaluated on two case studies of finding structurally similar ligands with similar binding affinity to a target protein, as well as on an external qualitative evaluation. The results suggest that our system allows effective visual inspection and comparison of different high-dimensional molecular representations.

By building VR prototypes as design probes, we identify key themes and factors for data visceralization. We do this first through a critical reflection by the authors, then by involving external participants. We find that data visceralization is an engaging way of understanding the qualitative aspects of physical measures and their real-life form, which complements analytical and quantitative understanding commonly gained from data visualization. However, data visceralization is most effective when there is a one-to-one mapping between data and representation, with transformations such as scaling affecting this understanding.

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game - one with narrative elements and one without - and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game. We report observations and qualitative feedback collected, and note areas for improvement and room for future work.", "keywords": "Visualization Literacy,Educational technology,Gamification,Narrative", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030464", "refList": ["10.1007/978-981-13-2694-3\\_2", "10.1145/2702123.2702298", "10.1145/2702123.2702558", "10.1007/978-981-13-2694-3\\_8", "10.1145/2702123.2702245", "10.1109/mis.2012.27", "10.18061/dsq.v21i4.318", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.134", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1007/s10708-008-9186-0", "10.1093/cje/ben057", "10.5210/fm.v16i2.3316", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598608", "10.1007/978-3-319-94659-7\\_10", "10.1109/mcg.2013.28", "10.17351/ests2017.134", "10.1109/pacificvis.2014.39", "10.1145/3173574.3173728", "10.1145/2598784.2598806", "10.1145/2491500.2491501", "10.1145/1993060.1993065", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2802520", "10.1145/3025453.3025667", "10.1145/2598510.2598566", "10.1080/15710882.2015.1081240", "10.17351/ests2017.133", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346431", "10.1016/j.ijhcs.2015.02.005", "10.1145/2702123.2702180", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70577", "10.1109/mcg.2019.2923483", "10.5931/djim.v12.i1.6449", "10.1145/3240167.3240206", "10.1145/2468356.2468739", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1145/3025453.3025751", "10.4018/978-1-4666-6497-5.ch003"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030355", "title": "Guidelines For Pursuing and Revealing Data Abstractions", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Alex Bigelow;Katy Williams;Katherine E.

In recent work we proposed a new, interpretivist perspective on design study and six companion criteria for rigor that highlight the opportunities for researchers to contribute knowledge that extends beyond visualization idioms and software. In this work we conducted a year-long collaboration with evolutionary biologists to develop an interactive tool for visual exploration of multivariate datasets and phylogenetic trees. During this design study we experimented with methods to support three of the rigor criteria: ABUNDANT, REFLEXIVE, and TRANSPARENT. As a result we contribute two novel visualization techniques for the analysis of multivariate phylogenetic datasets, three methodological recommendations for conducting design studies drawn from reflections over our process of experimentation, and two writing devices for reporting interpretivist design study.

To better understand the needs of this user group, we conduct a technical observation study of 50 public repositories of data and analysis code authored by 33 professional journalists at 26 news organizations. We develop two detailed and cross-cutting taxonomies of data wrangling in computational journalism, for actions and for processes. We observe the extensive use of multiple tables, a notable gap in previous wrangling analyses. We develop a concise, actionable framework for general multi-table data wrangling that includes wrangling operations documented in our taxonomy that are without clear parallels in other work. This framework, the first to incorporate tables as first-class objects, will support future interactive wrangling tools for both computational journalism and general-purpose use.

We propose a new metric called summative quality to compare evaluation methods according to their ability to prove usefulness, and make recommendations for selecting evaluation methods based on their summative quality in the VA domain.", "keywords": "Summative evaluation,usefulness,evaluation process,taxonomy,visual analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934264", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744478", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865025", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.85", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346331", "10.1109/beliv.2018.8634420", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745181", "10.1111/cgf.13677", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864844", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.126", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864811", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532147", "10.1177/0956797613504966", "10.1145/2669557.2669579", "10.1109/mcg.2005.102", "10.1109/visual.2003.1250426", "10.1136/bmj.39489.470347.ad", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744080", "10.1109/mcg.2009.53", "10.1111/j.1467-8527.2005.00307.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.132", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864886", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864843", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865028", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865051", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865044", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865026", "10.1007/978-3-540-71080-6\\_6", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865020", "10.1177/1473871611407399", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864504", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864526", "10.1109/tvcg.2005.53", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864905", "10.1049/sej.1991.0040", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2513410", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2711030", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.279", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585505", "10.1147/jrd.2010.2042914", "10.1016/s0378-7206(98)00044-5", "10.1145/2993901.2993913", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865041", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864812", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744758", "10.1145/1168149.1168158", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745279", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744738", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745083", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864826", "10.1145/1377966.1377974", "10.1109/apec.2009.4802646", "10.1145/1168149.1168152", "10.1016/j.jss.2008.03.059", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585484", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744818", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744358", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864499", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865042", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744898"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030388", "title": "Visualization of Human Spine Biomechanics for Spinal Surgery", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Pepe Eulzer;Sabine Bauer;Francis Kilian;Kai Lawonn", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Eulzer, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Jena, Jena, Germany.

Our goal is to support research in biomechanical spine simulation and advance efforts to implement simulation-backed analysis in surgical applications. Biomechanical simulation is a state-of-the-art technique for analyzing load distributions of spinal structures. Through the inclusion of patient-specific data, such simulations may facilitate personalized treatment and customized surgical interventions. Difficulties in spine modelling and simulation can be partly attributed to poor result representation, which may also be a hindrance when introducing such techniques into a clinical environment. Comparisons of measurements across multiple similar anatomical structures and the integration of temporal data make commonly available diagrams and charts insufficient for an intuitive and systematic display of results. Therefore, we facilitate methods such as multiple coordinated views, abstraction and focus and context to display simulation outcomes in a dedicated tool. $\\mathrm{By}$ linking the result data with patient-specific anatomy, we make relevant parameters tangible for clinicians. Furthermore, we introduce new concepts to show the directions of impact force vectors, which were not accessible before. We integrated our toolset into a spine segmentation and simulation pipeline and evaluated our methods with both surgeons and biomechanical researchers. When comparing our methods against standard representations that are currently in use, we found increases in accuracy and speed in data exploration tasks. $\\mathrm{in}$ a qualitative review, domain experts deemed the tool highly useful when dealing with simulation result data, which typically combines time-dependent patient movement and the resulting force distributions on spinal structures.", "keywords": "Medical visualization,bioinformatics,coordinated views,focus and context,biomechanical simulation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030388", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864903", "10.1177/1473871613510429", "10.1093/ehjqcco/qcz052", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70594", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865076", "10.1055/s-0039-1687862", "10.1109/visual.1990.146375", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744198", "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.10.001", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.124", "10.1016/j.jacc", "10.1111/cgf.13167", "10.17705/1thci.00055", "10.1136/bmjqs.2009.037895", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.238", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865240", "10.1186/1471-2261-6-34", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934264", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.200", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.209", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346682", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467091", "10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033208", "10.1109/beliv.2018.8634027", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467191", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467325", "10.1145/2133806.2133821", "10.1145/1806799.1806866", "10.1108/02635570610688869", "10.1002/hbm.20701", "10.1561/1100000039", "10.1145/3025453.3025645", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.120", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599030"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}], "len": 23}, "index": 788, "embedding": [0.17830787599086761, 2.038109540939331, -1.0366979837417603, -2.298758029937744, -0.6896921992301941, 0.16650904715061188, -0.6933266520500183, 0.4760083258152008, -0.36867234110832214, 1.4838567972183228, -1.647068977355957, 0.6998474597930908, -0.15391238033771515, 3.409285068511963, 4.977095127105713, 3.7522470951080322, 1.9355089664459229, 5.3553643226623535, -0.7390042543411255, -1.0093307495117188, -0.06630208343267441, 1.3188163042068481, 1.7947394847869873, 2.7728519439697266, -2.388123035430908, 1.8206920623779297, -0.561912477016449, 3.483051061630249, 0.7164861559867859, 0.13265974819660187, 1.1410573720932007, 2.755866050720215], "projection": [-0.439503014087677, 10.26539421081543], "size": 12, "height": 3, "width": 9}
