Although it is easy to identify these two types of occurrences, game developers often find it difficult to determine their causes and triggers with so many game design choices and game parameters involved. In addition, the huge amounts of MOBA game data are often heterogeneous, multi-dimensional and highly dynamic in terms of space and time, which poses special challenges for analysts. In this paper, we present a visual analytics system to help game designers find key events and game parameters resulting in snowballing or comeback occurrences in MOBA game data. We follow a user-centered design process developing the system with game analysts and testing with real data of a trial version MOBA game from NetEase Inc. We apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established ones to depict the evolution of players' positions, status and the occurrences of events. Our system can reveal players' strategies and performance throughout a single match and suggest patterns, e.g., specific player' actions and game events, that have led to the final occurrences. We further demonstrate a workflow of leveraging human analyzed patterns to improve the scalability and generality of match data analysis. Finally, we validate the usability of our system by proving the identified patterns are representative in snowballing or comeback matches in a one-month-long MOBA tournament dataset.", "keywords": "Game play data visualization;visual knowledge discovery;visual knowledge representation;and game reconstruction", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2016.2598415", "refList": ["10.1109/gem.2014.7048109", "10.1016/j.cag.2013.11.010", "10.1109/mcg.2013.26", "10.1007/s00371-013-0892-3", "10.1145/958720.958735", "10.5555/958720.958735", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.192", "10.1007/978-3-319-24589-8\\_9", "10.1016/j.entcom.2013.02.002", "10.1089/cyber.2011.0387", "10.1109/visual.2004.120", "10.1145/2702123.2702447", "10.1109/vast.2015.7347633", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.263", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042477", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042478", "10.3390/ijgi4042159", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042533", "10.1145/1389095.1389394", "10.1145/800049.801756", "10.1109/tciaig.2015.2466240", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346445"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/vast.2018.8802454", "title": "EmbeddingVis: A Visual Analytics Approach to Comparative Network Embedding Inspection", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Quan Li;Kristanto Sean Njotoprawiro;Hammad Haleem;Qiaoan Chen;Chris Yi;Xiaojuan Ma", "citationCount": "2", "affiliation": "Li, Q (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Univ Sci \\& Technol, Dept Comp Sci \\& Engn, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.

A successful MMORPG should engage players and meet their needs to achieve different cate-gories of gratifications. Research on the evolution of player social interaction network and the dynamics of inter-player intimacy could provide insights into players' gratification-oriented behaviors in MMORPGs. Such understanding could in turn guide game designs for better engaging existing players and marketing strategies for attracting newcomers. Conventional dynamic network analysis may help investigate game-based social interactions at the macroscopic level. However, current dynamic network visualization techniques mainly focus on illustrating topological changes of the entire network, which are unsuitable for analyzing player-specific social interactions in the virtual world from an egocentric perspective. In general, game designers and operators find it difficult to analyze the way players with different gratification needs may interact with one another and the consequences on their relationships with direct ties, using a decentralized social graph with complicated time-varying structures. In this paper, we present MMOSeer, a visual analytics system for exploring the evolution of egocentric player intimacy network. MMOSeer focuses on the relationship between a player (ego) and his/her directly-linked friends (alters). We follow a user-centered design process to develop the system with game analysts and apply novel visualization techniques in conjunction with well-established algorithms to depict the evolution of intimacy egocentric network. We also derive a centrality change metric to infer how the impact of changes in an ego's interactive behaviors may propagate through the intimacy network, reshaping the structure of the alters' social circles at both micro and macro levels. Finally, we validate the usability of MMOSeer by discovering different user interaction patterns and the corresponding ego-network structural changes in a real-world gameplay dataset from a commercial MMORPG.", "keywords": "H.5.2 {[}INFORMATION INTERFACES AND PRESENTATION]: User Interfaces-Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2017.8031576", "refList": ["10.1108/s0163-239620140000043016", "10.1007/s12110-003-1016-y", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.11", "10.1109/itw.2010.5593358", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.263", "10.1007/978-3-540-85891-1\\_8", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.254", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.142", "10.1089/cpb.2007.0066", "10.1109/iv.2013.57", "10.1109/asonam.2012.39", "10.1145/2556288.2557010", "10.1145/2512938.2512949", "10.1145/2531602.2531642", "10.1016/j.ipm.2011.09.001", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742388", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598415", "10.1080/13691180903266952", "10.1109/infvis.2001.963274", "10.1109/iv.2011.93", "10.1089/cpb.2007.9988", "10.1109/iv.2013.8", "10.1007/bf02289565", "10.5555/2999134.2999195"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/vast.2018.8802415", "title": "Segue: Overviewing Evolution Patterns of Egocentric Networks by Interactive Construction of Spatial Layouts", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Po-Ming Law;Yanhong Wu;Rahul C.

These spatial layouts provide overviews of the evolution patterns of ego-networks, thereby revealing different global patterns such as trends, clusters and outliers in evolution patterns. To let analysts interactively construct interpretable spatial layouts, we propose a data transformation pipeline, with which analysts can adjust the spatial layouts and convert dynamic ego-networks into event sequences to aid interpretations of the spatial positions.

Several case studies confirm the efficacy of our system. Experts' feedback suggests that our approach indeed helps them better embrace the understanding of network embedding models.", "keywords": "Human-centered computing,Visualization,Visualization application domains,Visual analytics,Human-centered computing,Visualization,Visualization design and evaluation methods", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2018.8802454", "refList": ["10.1145/2783258.2783417", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598838", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1145/2939672.2939754", "10.1109/icdm.2014.119", "10.1145/2939672.2939753", "10.3390/a10040109", "10.1016/j.im.2007.11.001", "10.1103/revmodphys.74.47", "10.1145/3097983.3098061", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1145/2736277.2741093", "10.1609/aimag.v29i3.2157", "10.1145/2783258.2783296", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2468151", "10.1145/2623330.2623732", "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031576", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745141", "10.1073/pnas.1116502109", "10.1145/3132847.3132919", "10.1155/2013/401723", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2465151", "10.1038/s41598-017-12586-y", "10.1103/physreve.78.046110", "10.1145/2939672.2939751", "10.1145/2470654.2470724", "10.1109/2.769447", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70521", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598415", "10.1145/2806416.2806512", "10.1145/3018661.3018667", "10.1145/3196709.3196771", "10.1007/978-4-431-68057-4\\_3", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.173", "10.1145/3097983.3098069"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00021", "year": "2019", "title": "Visual Analytics of Dynamic Interplay Between Behaviors in MMORPGs", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Junhua Lu;Xiao Xie;Ji Lan;Tai{-}Quan Peng;Wei Chen;Yingcai Wu", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Chen, W; Wu, YC (Corresponding Author), Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.\nLu, Junhua; Xie, Xiao; Lan, Ji; Chen, Wei; Wu, Yingcai, Zhejiang Univ, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, Peoples R China.\nPeng, Tai-Quan, Michigan State Univ, Dept Commun, E Lansing, MI 48824 USA.", "countries": "USA;China", "abstract": "The rapid development of massively multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPGs) has led operators to record huge amounts of fine-grained data from the in-game activities of players. These data provide considerable opportunities with which to study the dynamic interplay among player behaviors and investigate the roles of various social structures that underlie such interplay. However, modeling and visualizing these behavioral data remain a challenge. In this study, we propose a novel influence-susceptible model to measure the dynamic interplay among multiple behaviors. Based on this model, we introduce a new visual analytics system called BeXplorer.
