The technology is rapidly improving and may, in the long term, replace traditional flat panel displays in many situations. When displays are no longer intrinsically flat, how should we use the space around the user for abstract data visualisation? In this paper, we ask this question with respect to origin-destination flow data in a global geographic context. We report on the findings of three studies exploring different spatial encodings for flow maps. The first experiment focuses on different 2D and 3D encodings for flows on flat maps. We find that participants are significantly more accurate with raised flow paths whose height is proportional to flow distance but fastest with traditional straight line 2D flows. In our second and third experiment we compared flat maps, 3D globes and a novel interactive design we call<i>MapsLink</i>, involving a pair of linked flat maps. We find that participants took significantly more time with MapsLink than other flow maps while the 3D globe with raised flows was the fastest, most accurate, and most preferred method. Our work suggests that<i>careful</i>use of the third spatial dimension can resolve visual clutter in complex flow maps.", "keywords": "Origin-destination,Flow Map,Virtual Reality,Cartographic Information Visualisation,Immersive Analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2865192", "refList": ["10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01946.x", "10.1145/2254556.2254652", "10.1080/13658816.2017.1307378", "10.1179/caj.1971.8.2.139", "10.1080/17445647.2017.1313788", "10.1007/s00168-008-0256-5", "10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2009.01.007", "10.1145/1080402.1080411", "10.1109/infvis.2003.1249008", "10.1109/infvis.1995.528697", "10.1080/15230406.2016.1262280", "10.1093/comjnl/bxx117", "10.1145/159544.159587", "10.1109/glocom.2015.7417476", "10.1145/3013971.3013983", "10.1126/science.1248676", "10.1109/eitt.2017.18", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532150", "10.1080/03085696708592302", "10.1145/2702123.2702172", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.181", "10.1145/3126594.3126613", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742390", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598958", "10.4230/dagrep.6.6.1", "10.1109/infvis.1996.559226", "10.1007/978-3-319-03841-4\\_34", "10.1111/cgf.13431", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346441", "10.1179/000870410x12658023467367", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70521", "10.1109/icsens.2015.7370446", "10.2307/1791753", "10.1109/38.486685", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2520921", "10.1559/152304087783875273", "10.1007/bf01936872", "10.1016/j.jvlc.2016.07.006", "10.1109/3dvis.2014.7160094", "10.1111/j.0033-0124.1981.00419.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598885", "10.1111/j.1435-5597.1970.tb01464.x", "10.1177/1473871616681375", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.202", "10.1016/j.jvlc.2014.03.001"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030460", "title": "Personal Augmented Reality for Information Visualization on Large Interactive Displays", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Patrick Reipschl\u00e4ger;Tamara Flemisch;Raimund Dachselt", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Reipschlager, P (Corresponding Author), Tech Univ Dresden, Interact Media Lab, Dresden, Germany.

Even though large displays provide more display space, they are challenging with regard to perception, effective multi-user support, and managing data density and complexity. To address these issues and illustrate our proposed setup, we contribute an extensive design space comprising first, the spatial alignment of display, visualizations, and objects in AR space. Next, we discuss which parts of a visualization can be augmented. Finally, we analyze how AR can be used to display personal views in order to show additional information and to minimize the mutual disturbance of data analysts. Based on this conceptual foundation, we present a number of exemplary techniques for extending visualizations with AR and discuss their relation to our design space. We further describe how these techniques address typical visualization problems that we have identified during our literature research. To examine our concepts, we introduce a generic AR visualization framework as well as a prototype implementing several example techniques. In order to demonstrate their potential, we further present a use case walkthrough in which we analyze a movie data set. From these experiences, we conclude that the contributed techniques can be useful in exploring and understanding multivariate data.

Trajectories in sports, such as the movement of players and balls, contain rich information on player behavior and thus have been widely analyzed by coaches and analysts to improve the players' performance. However, existing visual analytics systems often present the trajectories in court diagrams that are abstractions of reality, thereby causing difficulty for the experts to imagine the situation on the court and understand why the player acted in a certain way. With recent developments in immersive technologies, such as virtual reality (VR), experts gradually have the opportunity to see, feel, explore, and understand these 3D trajectories from the player's perspective. Yet, few research has studied how to support immersive analysis of sports data from such a perspective. Specific challenges are rooted in data presentation (e.g., how to seamlessly combine 2D and 3D visualizations) and interaction (e.g., how to naturally interact with data without keyboard and mouse) in VR. To address these challenges, we have worked closely with domain experts who have worked for a top national badminton team to design ShuttleSpace. Our system leverages 1) the peripheral vision to combine the 2D and 3D visualizations and 2) the VR controller to support natural interactions via a stroke metaphor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ShuttleSpace through three case studies conducted by the experts with useful insights.

An elicitation workshop with key members of the building management team revealed relevant knowledge is distributed among multiple experts in their team, each using bespoke analysis tools. Uplift combines an engaging 3D model on a central tabletop display with intuitive tangible interaction, as well as augmented-reality, mid-air data visualisation, in order to support casual collaborative visual analytics for this complex domain. Evaluations with expert stakeholders from the building management and energy domains were conducted during and following our prototype development and indicate that Uplift is successful as an engaging backdrop for casual collaboration. Experts see high potential in such a system to bring together diverse knowledge holders and reveal complex interactions between structural, operational, and financial aspects of their domain. Such systems have further potential in other domains that require collaborative discussion or demonstration of models, forecasts, or cost-benefit analyses to high-level stakeholders.", "keywords": "Data visualisation,tangible and embedded interaction,augmented reality,immersive analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030334", "refList": ["10.1109/vr.2019.8797733", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865235", "10.1111/cgf.13213", "10.1109/mcg.2014.82", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.153", "10.1145/1240624.1240701", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.166", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1145/3343055.3359718", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00010", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.275", "10.1109/vr46266.2020.00-20", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.287", "10.3788/co.20201301.0001", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934803", "10.1145/3173574.3173610", "10.1145/2858036.2858524", "10.1145/3359996.3364242", "10.1145/3173574.3173593", "10.1177/1473871611412817", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745958", "10.1111/cgf.12871", "10.1145/2817721.2817735", "10.1145/2317956.2318025", "10.1145/1166253.1166280", "10.1007/978-3-319-73207-7", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934415", "10.1109/cmv.2007.20", "10.1109/vr46266.2020.1582298687237", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.162", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933673", "10.1109/mcg.2019.2897927", "10.1145/2702123.2702331", "10.1145/2576099", "10.1145/3290605.3300288", "10.1145/3173574.3173664", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532136", "10.1109/3dui.2014.6798842", "10.1145/302979.303113", "10.1145/3343055.3359709", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598608", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744199", "10.1145/1936652.1936676", "10.1117/12.2521648", "10.1080/15384047.2020.1806642", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.197", "10.1145/3009939.3009945", "10.1145/3126594.3126613", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2592906", "10.1109/mcg.2019.2898856", "10.1111/cgf.13206", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.163", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2640960", "10.1145/3173574.3173759", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744184", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745258", "10.1023/a:1021271517844", "10.1145/2817721.2817726", "10.1145/2858036.2858158", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865192", "10.1109/bigdata.2018.8622521", "10.1145/642611.642695", "10.1145/2785830.2785871", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.204", "10.1080/07370024.2019.1697697", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2903956", "10.1109/tcyb.2020.2970556", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.251", "10.1145/2702123.2702312", "10.1177/1473871611415997", "10.1145/2817721.2823505", "10.1145/3290605.3300521", "10.2312/eurp", "10.1145/2470654.2466431"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00022", "year": "2019", "title": "What-Why Analysis of Expert Interviews: Analysing Geographically-Embedded Flow Data", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Yalong Yang;Sarah Goodwin", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Yang, YL (Corresponding Author), Monash Univ, Caulfield Sch Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic, Australia.\nYang, Yalong; Goodwin, Sarah, Monash Univ, Caulfield Sch Informat Technol, Clayton, Vic, Australia.", "countries": "Australia", "abstract": "In this paper, we present our analysis of five expert interviews, each from a different application domain.
