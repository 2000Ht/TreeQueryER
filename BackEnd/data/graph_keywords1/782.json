Analysts often interweave querying and mining in a recursive manner during event sequence analysis: sequences extracted as query results are used for mining patterns, patterns generated are incorporated into a new query for segmenting the sequences, and the resulting segments are mined or queried again. To support flexible analysis, we propose a framework that describes the process of interwoven querying and mining. Based on this framework, we developed MAQUI, a Mining And Querying User Interface that enables recursive event sequence exploration. To understand the efficacy of MAQUI, we conducted two case studies with domain experts. The findings suggest that the capability of interweaving querying and mining helps the participants articulate their questions and gain novel insights from their data.", "keywords": "Sequential pattern mining,temporal query,event sequence exploration", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864886", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467622", "10.1145/2470654.2481325", "10.1007/978-3-319-06483-3\\_8", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1109/vast.2009.5332595", "10.1145/846183.846188", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346452", "10.1109/vast.2016.7883512", "10.1109/vast.2015.7347682", "10.1177/1473871614526077", "10.1016/j.jbi.2014.01.007", "10.1145/2856767.2856779", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598797", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745278", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.117", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.200", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744199", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2539960", "10.1145/2557500.2557508", "10.1145/319950.320010", "10.1145/775047.775109", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346682", "10.1016/j.intcom.2012.01.003", "10.1016/j.jbi.2014.09.003", "10.1109/vlhcc.2009.5295262", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745083", "10.1007/s40273-015-0333-4", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346574", "10.1111/cgf.13208", "10.1145/3025453.3025777"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934264", "title": "The Validity, Generalizability and Feasibility of Summative Evaluation Methods in Visual Analytics", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Mosab Khayat;Morteza Karimzadeh;David S.

Our goal is to support research in biomechanical spine simulation and advance efforts to implement simulation-backed analysis in surgical applications. Biomechanical simulation is a state-of-the-art technique for analyzing load distributions of spinal structures. Through the inclusion of patient-specific data, such simulations may facilitate personalized treatment and customized surgical interventions. Difficulties in spine modelling and simulation can be partly attributed to poor result representation, which may also be a hindrance when introducing such techniques into a clinical environment. Comparisons of measurements across multiple similar anatomical structures and the integration of temporal data make commonly available diagrams and charts insufficient for an intuitive and systematic display of results.

When comparing our methods against standard representations that are currently in use, we found increases in accuracy and speed in data exploration tasks. $\\mathrm{in}$ a qualitative review, domain experts deemed the tool highly useful when dealing with simulation result data, which typically combines time-dependent patient movement and the resulting force distributions on spinal structures.", "keywords": "Medical visualization,bioinformatics,coordinated views,focus and context,biomechanical simulation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030388", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864903", "10.1177/1473871613510429", "10.1093/ehjqcco/qcz052", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70594", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865076", "10.1055/s-0039-1687862", "10.1109/visual.1990.146375", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744198", "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.10.001", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.124", "10.1016/j.jacc", "10.1111/cgf.13167", "10.17705/1thci.00055", "10.1136/bmjqs.2009.037895", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.238", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865240", "10.1186/1471-2261-6-34", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934264", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.200", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.209", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346682", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467091", "10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033208", "10.1109/beliv.2018.8634027", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467191", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467325", "10.1145/2133806.2133821", "10.1145/1806799.1806866", "10.1108/02635570610688869", "10.1002/hbm.20701", "10.1561/1100000039", "10.1145/3025453.3025645", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.120", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599030"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934661", "title": "Visual Analysis of High-Dimensional Event Sequence Data via Dynamic Hierarchical Aggregation", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "David Gotz;Jonathan Zhang;Wenyuan Wang;Joshua Shrestha;David Borland", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Gotz, D (Corresponding Author), Univ N Carolina, Sch Informat \\& Lib Sci, Chapel Hill, NC 27515 USA.

These techniques generally display aggregate statistics computed over sets of event sequences that share common patterns. Such techniques are often hindered, however, by the high-dimensionality of many real-world event sequence datasets which can prevent effective aggregation. A common coping strategy for this challenge is to group event types together prior to visualization, as a pre-process, so that each group can be represented within an analysis as a single event type. However, computing these event groupings as a pre-process also places significant constraints on the analysis. This paper presents a new visual analytics approach for dynamic hierarchical dimension aggregation. The approach leverages a predefined hierarchy of dimensions to computationally quantify the informativeness, with respect to a measure of interest, of alternative levels of grouping within the hierarchy at runtime. This information is then interactively visualized, enabling users to dynamically explore the hierarchy to select the most appropriate level of grouping to use at any individual step within an analysis. Key contributions include an algorithm for interactively determining the most informative set of event groupings for a specific analysis context, and a scented scatter-plus-focus visualization design with an optimization-based layout algorithm that supports interactive hierarchical exploration of alternative event type groupings. We apply these techniques to high-dimensional event sequence data from the medical domain and report findings from domain expert interviews.", "keywords": "Temporal event sequence visualization,visual analytics,hierarchical aggregation,medical informatics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934661", "refList": ["10.1145/937549.937550", "10.1109/infvis.2000.885091", "10.1145/2468356.2468434", "10.1016/j.jbi.2012.01.009", "10.1136/amiajnl-2014-002747", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.108", "10.1145/2702123.2702419", "10.3233/978-1-61499-289-9-1224", "10.13063/2327-9214", "10.1109/vast.2016.7883512", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01898.x", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532152", "10.1177/1473871614526077", "10.1016/j.jbi.2014.01.007", "10.1145/2856767.2856779", "10.1038/nrg3208", "10.1001/jama.2014.4228", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.238", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745278", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864886", "10.2307/2983604", "10.1145/3009973", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.200", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2539960", "10.1200/jco.2010.28.5478", "10.1145/2557500.2557508", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346682", "10.1111/cgf.12883", "10.1145/2678025.2701407", "10.1109/vast.2011.6102443", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.84", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70589", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745320", "10.3233/978-1-61499-830-3-1327", "10.1136/jamia.2009.000893", "10.1186/2047-2501-2-3", "10.1145/2890478", "10.2307/2685881", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042487", "10.1561/1100000039", "10.1109/mcg.2016.59", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744686", "10.1109/vds.2017.8573439", "10.1016/j.otohns.2010.05.007", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346433"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 7}, "index": 782, "embedding": [0.3455677330493927, 1.2140779495239258, 0.6539798378944397, 2.385239601135254, -0.6897369623184204, 0.16650904715061188, -0.664513111114502, 2.149648904800415, -0.46884602308273315, -0.9566591382026672, 0.7502173185348511, 0.5815397500991821, -0.1686236411333084, 1.886772871017456, 0.8719632029533386, 1.4553565979003906, -0.04010612145066261, 0.06877747178077698, -0.7571966052055359, 1.1184457540512085, -0.06630208343267441, 2.1685967445373535, 0.20976512134075165, -0.14396654069423676, 0.2618531882762909, 0.04334019869565964, -0.5834015607833862, 0.3282211720943451, 2.1307389736175537, -0.12675319612026215, 0.7520933747291565, 1.4096920490264893], "projection": [-3.700915813446045, 7.363563537597656], "size": 4, "height": 3, "width": 2}
