Given a network topology, it is critical to understand how different applications, job placements, routing schemes, etc., are affected by and contribute to network congestion, especially for large and complex networks. Understanding and optimizing communication on large-scale networks is an active area of research. Domain experts often use exploratory tools to develop both intuitive and formal metrics for network health and performance. This paper presents TreeScope, an interactive, web-based visualization tool for exploring network traffic on large-scale fat-tree networks. TreeScope encodes the network topology using a tailored matrix-based representation and provides detailed visualization of all traffic in the network. We report on the design process of TreeScope, which has been received positively by network researchers as well as system administrators. Through case studies of real and simulated data, we demonstrate how TreeScope's visual design and interactive support for complex queries on network traffic can provide experts with new insights into the occurrences and causes of congestion in the network.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13442", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2015.2489649", "10.1147/rd.492.0265", "10.1109/cluster.2017.26", "10.1002/j.1538-7305.1953.tb01433.x", "10.1109/icpads.2015.92", "10.1109/vpa.2014.7", "10.1109/38.135886", "10.1109/52.84214", "10.1109/vpa.2014.10", "10.1109/comst.2016.2626784", "10.1109/ipdps.2013.96", "10.1109/2945.841119", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.124", "10.1109/tc.1985.6312192", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532136", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.286", "10.1109/vpa.2014.6", "10.1016/j.cag.2010.11.015", "10.1145/1168149.1168168", "10.1109/ipdps.2016.123", "10.1145/2470654.2470724", "10.1109/infvis.2004.1", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.160", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1109/mcg.2006.120", "10.1109/tvcg.2005.63", "10.1109/clustr.2001.959990", "10.1145/2133806.2133821", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500092", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2466971", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1179/000870403235002042"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.1029", "year": "2020", "title": "LBVis: Interactive Dynamic Load Balancing Visualization for Parallel Particle Tracing", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Jiang Zhang;Changhe Yang;Yanda Li;Li Chen;Xiaoru Yuan", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Yuan, XR (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Machine Percept, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nYuan, XR (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Sch EECS, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nYuan, XR (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Beijing Engn Technol Res Ctr Virtual Simulat \\& Vi, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nZhang, Jiang; Yang, Changhe; Li, Yanda; Yuan, Xiaoru, Peking Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Machine Percept, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nZhang, Jiang; Yang, Changhe; Li, Yanda; Yuan, Xiaoru, Peking Univ, Sch EECS, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nYuan, Xiaoru, Peking Univ, Beijing Engn Technol Res Ctr Virtual Simulat \\& Vi, Beijing, Peoples R China.\nChen, Li, Tsinghua Univ, Sch Software, Inst CG\\&CAD, Beijing, Peoples R China.", "countries": "China", "abstract": "We propose an interactive visual analytical approach to exploring and diagnosing the dynamic load balance (data and task partition) process of parallel particle tracing in flow visualization. To understand the complex nature of the parallel processes, it is necessary to integrate the information of the behaviors and patterns of the computing processes, data changes and movements, task status and exchanges, and gain the insight of the relationships among them. In our proposed approach, the data and task behaviors are visualized through a graph with a fine-designed layout, in which node glyphs are dedicated to showing the status of processes and the links represent the data or task transfer between different computation rounds and processes. User interactions are supported to facilitate the exploration of performance analysis. We provide a case study to demonstrate that the proposed approach enables users to identify the bottlenecks during this process, and thus help optimize the related algorithms.", "keywords": "Parallel particle tracing; load balancing; performance analysis; visual analytics", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis48177.2020.1029", "refList": ["10.1109/vast.2017.8585646", "10.1145/1654059.1654113", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.196", "10.1109/ldav.2013.6675152", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00019", "10.1177/109434209901300310", "10.1177/1094342006064482", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.219", "10.1111/cgf.12101", "10.1002/cpe.1553", "10.1109/vpa.2014.7", "10.1111/cgf.13442", "10.1109/vpa.2014.8", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865026", "10.1109/vpa.2014.10", "10.1109/ipdps.2011.62"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1478, "embedding": [-0.16668915748596191, -0.022407153621315956, 0.8861655592918396, 1.4897351264953613, -0.6745967864990234, 0.16650904715061188, -0.700136661529541, -0.6549844145774841, -0.43282294273376465, -0.8137040734291077, -0.17798398435115814, -0.4242304861545563, -0.13324885070323944, 0.4903198778629303, -0.04395618289709091, 0.12119749188423157, -0.07725496590137482, 0.08175134658813477, -0.38596388697624207, 1.4600030183792114, -0.06630208343267441, -0.10660473257303238, 0.05278356000781059, -0.12925946712493896, 0.2497892677783966, 0.09129026532173157, -0.5500518083572388, -0.16255053877830505, 0.18518885970115662, 0.09136305749416351, 0.011769707314670086, 0.192996084690094], "projection": [-3.07930588722229, 6.015061855316162], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
