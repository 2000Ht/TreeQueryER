Today, the most frequently used atom-based representations are the Space-filling, the Solvent Excluded Surface, the Balls-and-Sticks, and the Licorice models. While each of these representations has its individual benefits, when applied to large-scale models spatial arrangements can be difficult to interpret when employing current visualization techniques. In the past it has been shown that global illumination techniques improve the perception of molecular visualizations; unfortunately existing approaches are tailored towards a single visual representation. We propose a general illumination model for molecular visualization that is valid for different representations. With our illumination model, it becomes possible, for the first time, to achieve consistent illumination among all atom-based molecular representations. The proposed model can be further evaluated in real-time, as it employs an analytical solution to simulate diffuse light interactions between objects. To be able to derive such a solution for the rather complicated and diverse visual representations, we propose the use of regression analysis together with adapted parameter sampling strategies as well as shape parametrization guided sampling, which are applied to the geometric building blocks of the targeted visual representations. We will discuss the proposed sampling strategies, the derived illumination model, and demonstrate its capabilities when visualizing several dynamic molecules.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13426", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2009.157", "10.1145/2461912.2462009", "10.1111/cgf.12374", "10.2312/spbg/spbg06/059-065", "10.1007/s00371-017-1397-2", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.115", "10.1016/j.cag.2015.07.017", "10.1111/cgf.12627", "10.1002/(sici)1097-0282(199603)38:3", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467293", "10.1016/j.visres.2010.09.006", "10.1111/cgf.12349", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01917.x", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01693.x", "10.1111/cgf.12197", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183593", "10.1109/icra.2015.7139702", "10.1007/978-90-481-2678-1\\_6", "10.1006/jsbi.1996.0022", "10.1109/biovis.2011.6094043", "10.1111/cgf.12370"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934612", "title": "Multi-Scale Procedural Animations of Microtubule Dynamics Based on Measured Data", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Tobias Klein;Ivan Viola;M.

One example for such structures are microtubules, which are present in every eukaryotic cell. They are part of the cytoskeleton maintaining the shape of the cell and playing a key role in the cell division. In this paper, we propose a scientifically-accurate multi-scale procedural model of microtubule dynamics as a novel application scenario for procedural animation, which can generate visualizations of their overall shape, molecular structure, as well as animations of the dynamic behaviour of their growth and disassembly. The model is spanning from tens of micrometers down to atomic resolution. All the aspects of the model are driven by scientific data. The advantage over a traditional, manual animation approach is that when the underlying data change, for instance due to new evidence, the model can be recreated immediately. The procedural animation concept is presented in its generic form, with several novel extensions, facilitating an easy translation to other domains with emergent multi-scale behavior.", "keywords": "Procedural modeling,molecular visualization,animation,microtubules", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934612", "refList": ["10.1145/1141911.1141931", "10.1016/j.cell.2008.06.013", "10.1111/cgf.12068", "10.1111/cgf.12374", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01636.x", "10.1111/cgf.13426", "10.1093/nar/28.1.235", "10.1007/s00018-009-0245-6", "10.1016/j.jmb.2018.06.009", "10.1111/cgf.12370", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744518", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2350479", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744258", "10.1145/3154353.3154364", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03128.x", "10.1126/science.1252884", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.115", "10.2312/vcbm.20151209", "10.1016/j.cag.2015.07.017", "10.1111/cgf.12312", "10.1145/1866158.1866183", "10.1109/mcg.2008.58", "10.2312/vcbm.20181244", "10.1002/9780470719442.ch13", "10.2312/vcbm.20161267", "10.1103/physreve.50.1579", "10.1111/cgf.12315", "10.1016/j.cag.2010.11.011", "10.1111/cgf.13072", "10.1111/cgf.13611", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01917.x", "10.1038/nrm3874", "10.1083/jcb.120.4.923", "10.1111/cgf.12197", "10.1016/0968-0004(91)90083-8", "10.1145/1141911.1142016", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2877076", "10.1111/cgf.13701", "10.1145/545261.545288", "10.1016/j.sbi.2015.03.015", "10.1016/j.str.2010.12.023", "10.1038/nmeth.3204", "10.1083/jcb.18.2.367"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1462, "embedding": [0.3414986729621887, 0.021692000329494476, 0.09289281815290451, -0.06814674288034439, -0.6721880435943604, 0.16650904715061188, 0.38454824686050415, 0.9466208219528198, -0.29436513781547546, -0.8404330611228943, 0.5219795107841492, -1.054804801940918, -0.15996834635734558, 0.3337743282318115, -0.24779349565505981, 0.5403968691825867, -0.24351109564304352, 0.05552856996655464, -0.7097932696342468, 0.8527087569236755, -0.06630208343267441, 0.7941785454750061, -0.38047677278518677, -0.1577943116426468, -1.7981808185577393, 0.061810001730918884, -0.5581337213516235, -0.04061136767268181, -0.11850526928901672, 0.4062841832637787, -0.31888532638549805, 0.15441270172595978], "projection": [-4.698390007019043, 5.643360137939453], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
