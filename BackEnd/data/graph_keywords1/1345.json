This concurrent analysis becomes difficult when data are grouped and split into small multiples for comparison. A design challenge is thus to provide representations that enable multiple perspectives, split into small multiples, to be viewed simultaneously in ways that neither clutter nor overload. We present a design framework that allows us to do this. We claim that multi-perspective comparison across small multiples may be possible by superimposing perspectives on one another rather than juxtaposing those perspectives side-by-side. This approach defies conventional wisdom and likely results in visual and informational clutter. For this reason we propose designs at three levels of abstraction for each perspective. By flexibly varying the abstraction level, certain perspectives can be brought into, or out of, focus. We evaluate our framework through laboratory-style user tests. We find that superimposing, rather than juxtaposing, perspective views has little effect on performance of a low-level comparison task. We reflect on the user study and its design to further identify analysis situations for which our framework may be desirable. Although the user study findings were insufficiently discriminating, we believe our framework opens up a new design space for multi-perspective visual analysis.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12900", "refList": ["10.1145/571647.571649", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.149", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183556", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70583", "10.2307/2288400", "10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2005.07.009", "10.1016/j.giq.2013.02.001", "10.1016/j.compenvurbsys.2005.11.001", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.242", "10.1145/345513.345271", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.84", "10.1027/1864-9335/a000204", "10.1109/pacificvis.2014.43", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70535", "10.1179/000870403235002042", "10.1037/0003-066x.45.12.1304"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865076", "title": "IDMVis: Temporal Event Sequence Visualization for Type 1 Diabetes Treatment Decision Support", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Yixuan Zhang;Kartik Chanana;Cody Dunne", "citationCount": "11", "affiliation": "Zhang, YX (Corresponding Author), Northeastern Univ, Boston, MA 02115 USA.

We conducted a design study over 18 months with clinicians performing intensive diabetes management. We present a data abstraction and novel hierarchical task abstraction for this domain.

We propose that rigor is established and judged according to the extent to which visualization design study research and its reporting are INFORMED, REFLEXIVE, ABUNDANT, PLAUSIBLE, RESONANT, and TRANSPARENT. This perspective and the criteria were constructed through a four-year engagement with the discourse around rigor and the nature of knowledge in social science, information systems, and design. We suggest methods from cognate disciplines that can support visualization researchers in meeting these criteria during the planning, execution, and reporting of design study. Through a series of deliberately provocative questions, we explore implications of this new perspective for design study research in visualization, concluding that as a discipline, visualization is not yet well positioned to embrace, nurture, and fully benefit from a rigorous, interpretivist approach to design study.

To provide a solution for scrutinizing such complex data, we introduce ChemVA, an interactive application for the visual exploration of large molecular ensembles and their features. Our tool consists of multiple coordinated views: Hexagonal view, Detail view, 3D view, Table view, and a newly proposed Difference view designed for the comparison of DR projections. These views display DR projections combined with biological activity, selected molecular features, and confidence scores for each of these projections. This conjunction of views allows the user to drill down through the dataset and to efficiently select candidate compounds. Our approach was evaluated on two case studies of finding structurally similar ligands with similar binding affinity to a target protein, as well as on an external qualitative evaluation. The results suggest that our system allows effective visual inspection and comparison of different high-dimensional molecular representations.

While this abstraction is a powerful basis for data visualization, the connection between the representation and the original underlying data (i.e., what the quantities and measurements actually correspond with in reality) can be lost. On the other hand, virtual reality (VR) is being increasingly used to represent real and abstract models as natural experiences to users. In this work, we explore the potential of using VR to help restore the basic understanding of units and measures that are often abstracted away in data visualization in an approach we call data visceralization. By building VR prototypes as design probes, we identify key themes and factors for data visceralization. We do this first through a critical reflection by the authors, then by involving external participants. We find that data visceralization is an engaging way of understanding the qualitative aspects of physical measures and their real-life form, which complements analytical and quantitative understanding commonly gained from data visualization. However, data visceralization is most effective when there is a one-to-one mapping between data and representation, with transformations such as scaling affecting this understanding. We conclude with a discussion of future directions for data visceralization.", "keywords": "Data visceralization,virtual reality,exploratory study", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030435", "refList": ["10.1080/01973762.2013.761106", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467811", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.221", "10.1145/3284179.3284326", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934287", "10.1109/2945.841119", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.1109/mcg.2013.101", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.175", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2830759", "10.1109/3dvis.2014.7160096", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2878900", "10.1109/iv.2011.32", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.196", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865241", "10.1515/abitech-2017-0002", "10.1145/2468356.2468739", "10.16995/olh.280", "10.1080/15230406.2018.1513343", "10.1109/iv.2004.1320189", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1109/mcg.2006.120", "10.1109/icdar.2017.286", "10.1371/journal.pone.0146368", "10.1080/1472586x.2011.548488", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346574", "10.1080/0013838x.2017.1332021"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030464", "title": "Designing Narrative-Focused Role-Playing Games for Visualization Literacy in Young Children", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Elaine Huynh;Angela Nyhout;Patricia Ganea;Fanny Chevalier", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Huynh, E (Corresponding Author), Univ Toronto, Dept Comp Sci, Toronto, ON, Canada.

Visualization literacy skills are vital in understanding the world around us and constructing meaningful visualizations, yet, how to better develop these skills at an early age remains largely overlooked and understudied. Only recently has the visualization community started to fill this gap, resulting in preliminary studies and development of educational tools for use in early education. We add to these efforts through the exploration of gamification to support learning, and identify an opportunity to apply role-playing game-based designs by leveraging the presence of narratives in data-related problems involving visualizations. We study the effects of including narrative elements on learning through a technology probe, grounded in a set of design considerations stemming from visualization, game design and education science. We create two versions of a game - one with narrative elements and one without - and evaluate our instances on 33 child participants between 11- to 13-years old using a between-subjects study design. Despite participants requiring double the amount of time to complete their game due to additional narrative elements, the inclusion of such elements were found to improve engagement without sacrificing learning; our results indicate no significant differences in development of graph-reading skills, but significant differences in engagement and overall enjoyment of the game.

With the advent of industry 4.0, plenty of data recording the status of factory resources have been collected and further involved in production planning, which brings an unprecedented opportunity to understand, evaluate and adjust complex production plans through a data-driven approach. However, developing a systematic analytics approach for production planning is challenging due to the large volume of production data, the complex dependency between products, and unexpected changes in the market and the plant. Previous studies only provide summarized results and fail to show details for comparative analysis of production plans. Besides, the rapid adjustment to the plan in the case of an unanticipated incident is also not supported. In this paper, we propose PlanningVis, a visual analytics system to support the exploration and comparison of production plans with three levels of details: a plan overview presenting the overall difference between plans, a product view visualizing various properties of individual products, and a production detail view displaying the product dependency and the daily production details in related factories. By integrating an automatic planning algorithm with interactive visual explorations, PlanningVis can facilitate the efficient optimization of daily production planning as well as support a quick response to unanticipated incidents in manufacturing. Two case studies with real-world data and carefully designed interviews with domain experts demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of PlanningVis.", "keywords": "Production Planning,Time Series Data,Comparative Analysis,Visual Analytics,Smart Factory,Industry 4.0", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934275", "refList": ["10.1109/infvis.2002.1173149", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2614803", "10.1177/1473871611416549", "10.1109/wsc.2010.5679027", "10.1016/j.jvlc.2017.11.004", "10.1559/152304009788188808", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2796591", "10.1137/0201010", "10.1016/j.cor.2008.10.009", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.185", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865076", "10.1016/s0377-2217(00)00196-x", "10.1016/j.compchemeng.2009.06.007", "10.1016/s0924-0136(03)00520-x", "10.1109/hicss.2013.482", "10.1109/38.536268", "10.1109/mcg.2015.45", "10.1109/iv.2001.942082", "10.1287/mnsc.18.1.12", "10.1109/infvis.2005.1532144", "10.1115/1.4034872", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.225", "10.1016/j.ijpe.2004.11.017", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598664", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346454", "10.1109/pacificvis.2010.5429613", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.166", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467751", "10.1109/infvis.2001.963273", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745083", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.162", "10.1007/bf02289565", "10.1109/infvis.1999.801851", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00026", "10.1115/1.4037479", "10.1016/j.ijpe.2005.09.001", "10.1007/978-0-85729-079-3", "10.1145/1133265.1133348"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934285", "title": "Visualizing a Moving Target: A Design Study on Task Parallel Programs in the Presence of Evolving Data and Concerns", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Katy Williams;Alex Bigelow;Katherine E.

The increasing size of CNN models, however, prevents them from being widely deployed to devices with limited computational resources, e.g., mobile/embedded devices. The emerging topic of model pruning strives to address this problem by removing less important neurons and fine-tuning the pruned networks to minimize the accuracy loss. Nevertheless, existing automated pruning solutions often rely on a numerical threshold of the pruning criteria, lacking the flexibility to optimally balance the trade-off between efficiency and accuracy. Moreover, the complicated interplay between the stages of neuron pruning and model fine-tuning makes this process opaque, and therefore becomes difficult to optimize. In this paper, we address these challenges through a visual analytics approach, named CNNPruner. It considers the importance of convolutional filters through both instability and sensitivity, and allows users to interactively create pruning plans according to a desired goal on model size or accuracy. Also, CNNPruner integrates state-of-the-art filter visualization techniques to help users understand the roles that different filters played and refine their pruning plans.

The academic visualization community has produced a large body of work for reporting on design studies, informed by a handful of theoretical frameworks, and applied to a broad range of application areas. The result is an abundance of reported insights into visualization design, with an emphasis on novel visualization techniques and systems as the primary contribution of these studies. In recent work we proposed a new, interpretivist perspective on design study and six companion criteria for rigor that highlight the opportunities for researchers to contribute knowledge that extends beyond visualization idioms and software. In this work we conducted a year-long collaboration with evolutionary biologists to develop an interactive tool for visual exploration of multivariate datasets and phylogenetic trees. During this design study we experimented with methods to support three of the rigor criteria: ABUNDANT, REFLEXIVE, and TRANSPARENT. As a result we contribute two novel visualization techniques for the analysis of multivariate phylogenetic datasets, three methodological recommendations for conducting design studies drawn from reflections over our process of experimentation, and two writing devices for reporting interpretivist design study. We offer this work as an example for implementing the rigor criteria to produce a diverse range of knowledge contributions.", "keywords": "Methodologies,Application Motivated Visualization,Guidelines,Life Sciences Visualization,Health,Medicine,Biology,Bioinformatics,Genomics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030405", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934790", "10.1177/146879410200200205", "10.2312/eurovisshort", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467811", "10.1111/j.1467-6486.2009.00859.x", "10.1177/1473871613510429", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864836", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865076", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.231", "10.1002/cphy.c100079", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865149", "10.1080/1750984x.2017.1317357", "10.1007/978-3-7643-8472-2\\_6", "10.1111/cgf.13728", "10.2307/1511837", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934539", "10.3233/efi-2004-22201", "10.1080/17493460802276893", "10.1002/chp.1340180402", "10.1111/2041-210x.12034", "10.1111/j.2041-210x.2011.00169.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467452", "10.1002/chp", "10.1177/1077800410383121", "10.1002/cpbi.96", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864526", "10.1109/beliv.2018.8634026", "10.2307/1511637", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346431", "10.1111/cgf.12883", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934281", "10.1145/2993901.2993916", "10.2307/3178066", "10.1145/2993901.2993913", "10.1145/1182475.1182476", "10.1016/j.destud.2004.06.002", "10.1177/1609406918763214", "10.2312/eurovisshort.20151137", "10.1145/882262.882291", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2898186", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2811488", "10.1007/s11135-006-9044-4", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1111/2041-210x.12066", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2874523", "10.1177/1609406920909938"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030388", "title": "Visualization of Human Spine Biomechanics for Spinal Surgery", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Pepe Eulzer;Sabine Bauer;Francis Kilian;Kai Lawonn", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Eulzer, P (Corresponding Author), Univ Jena, Jena, Germany.

Our goal is to support research in biomechanical spine simulation and advance efforts to implement simulation-backed analysis in surgical applications. Biomechanical simulation is a state-of-the-art technique for analyzing load distributions of spinal structures. Through the inclusion of patient-specific data, such simulations may facilitate personalized treatment and customized surgical interventions. Difficulties in spine modelling and simulation can be partly attributed to poor result representation, which may also be a hindrance when introducing such techniques into a clinical environment. Comparisons of measurements across multiple similar anatomical structures and the integration of temporal data make commonly available diagrams and charts insufficient for an intuitive and systematic display of results. Therefore, we facilitate methods such as multiple coordinated views, abstraction and focus and context to display simulation outcomes in a dedicated tool. $\\mathrm{By}$ linking the result data with patient-specific anatomy, we make relevant parameters tangible for clinicians. Furthermore, we introduce new concepts to show the directions of impact force vectors, which were not accessible before. We integrated our toolset into a spine segmentation and simulation pipeline and evaluated our methods with both surgeons and biomechanical researchers. When comparing our methods against standard representations that are currently in use, we found increases in accuracy and speed in data exploration tasks. $\\mathrm{in}$ a qualitative review, domain experts deemed the tool highly useful when dealing with simulation result data, which typically combines time-dependent patient movement and the resulting force distributions on spinal structures.", "keywords": "Medical visualization,bioinformatics,coordinated views,focus and context,biomechanical simulation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030388", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864903", "10.1177/1473871613510429", "10.1093/ehjqcco/qcz052", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70594", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865076", "10.1055/s-0039-1687862", "10.1109/visual.1990.146375", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744198", "10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2014.10.001", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.124", "10.1016/j.jacc", "10.1111/cgf.13167", "10.17705/1thci.00055", "10.1136/bmjqs.2009.037895", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.238", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865240", "10.1186/1471-2261-6-34", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934264", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.200", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.209", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346682", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467091", "10.1136/bmjopen-2019-033208", "10.1109/beliv.2018.8634027", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.213", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467191", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467325", "10.1145/2133806.2133821", "10.1145/1806799.1806866", "10.1108/02635570610688869", "10.1002/hbm.20701", "10.1561/1100000039", "10.1145/3025453.3025645", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.120", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599030"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 35}], "len": 37}, "index": 1345, "embedding": [-1.9299184083938599, 1.2788877487182617, -1.0254276990890503, -2.4638969898223877, -0.6602144837379456, 0.16650904715061188, 1.769822359085083, -0.17769546806812286, -0.43060755729675293, 1.8981091976165771, -1.4184900522232056, -0.2271052747964859, -0.13366082310676575, 0.6172810196876526, 3.6368799209594727, 2.276498556137085, -0.17697305977344513, 4.0812273025512695, -0.6607173681259155, -0.7719935178756714, -0.06630208343267441, 2.6676723957061768, 1.263242483139038, 2.3999602794647217, -2.4643778800964355, 3.0778310298919678, -0.5077023506164551, 1.9819982051849365, 0.31594669818878174, -0.5586233735084534, 0.02437617816030979, 1.7900586128234863], "projection": [-0.670682430267334, 10.444157600402832], "size": 19, "height": 4, "width": 9}
