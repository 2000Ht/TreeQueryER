Although techniques based on aggregation, topology, and topic modeling have proven their usefulness, the visual analysis of smooth and/or abrupt data variations as well as the evolution of such variations over time are aspects not properly tackled by existing methods. In this work we propose a novel visualization methodology that relies on graph wavelet theory and stacked graph metaphor to enable the visual analysis of time-varying data defined on the nodes of a graph. The proposed method is able to identify regions where data presents abrupt and mild spacial and/or temporal variation while still been able to show how such changes evolve over time, making the identification of events an easier task. The usefulness of our approach is shown through a set of results using synthetic as well as a real data set involving taxi trips in downtown Manhattan. The methodology was able to reveal interesting phenomena and events such as the identification of specific locations with abrupt variation in the number of taxi pickups.", "keywords": "Time-varying data, graph wavelets, stacked graph visualization", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2015.7347624", "refList": ["10.1111/cgf.12114", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.226", "10.1109/msp.2014.2329213", "10.1109/icassp.2012.6288775", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.228", "10.1109/pacificvis.2014.56", "10.1109/pacificvis.2014.50", "10.1007/s11704-013-3009-2", "10.1109/itsc.2014.6957939", "10.1109/infvis.2000.885098", "10.1016/s0893-6080(05)80056-5", "10.1109/vast.2008.4677356", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742386", "10.1016/j.cag.2007.01.030", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346449", "10.1016/j.acha.2010.04.005", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.110", "10.1109/msp.2012.2235192"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934280", "title": "Motion Browser: Visualizing and Understanding Complex Upper Limb Movement Under Obstetrical Brachial Plexus Injuries", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Gromit Yeuk-Yin Chan;Luis Gustavo Nonato;Alice Chu;Preeti Raghavan;Viswanath Aluru;Cl\u00e1udio T.

Nowadays, the coordination between the muscles to generate simple movements is still not well understood, hindering the knowledge of how to best treat patients with this type of peripheral nerve injury. To acquire enough information for medical data analysis, physicians conduct motion analysis assessments with patients to produce a rich dataset of electromyographic signals from multiple muscles recorded with joint movements during real-world tasks. However, tools for the analysis and visualization of the data in a succinct and interpretable manner are currently not available. Without the ability to integrate, compare, and compute multiple data sources in one platform, physicians can only compute simple statistical values to describe patient's behavior vaguely, which limits the possibility to answer clinical questions and generate hypotheses for research. To address this challenge, we have developed Motion Browser, an interactive visual analytics system which provides an efficient framework to extract and compare muscle activity patterns from the patient's limbs and coordinated views to help users analyze muscle signals, motion data, and video information to address different tasks. The system was developed as a result of a collaborative endeavor between computer scientists and orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation physicians. We present case studies showing physicians can utilize the information displayed to understand how individuals coordinate their muscles to initiate appropriate treatment and generate new hypotheses for future research.", "keywords": "Medical Data Visualization,Visual Analytics Application,Time Series Data,Multimodal Data,Brachial Plexus Injuries", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934280", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2006.85", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01681.x", "10.1145/2659766.2659772", "10.1007/s00402-015-2180-3", "10.1145/2254556.2254639", "10.1117/12.2080001", "10.1016/j.jse.2015.12.006", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01919.x", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.178", "10.1080/001401398186063", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.195", "10.2519/jospt.2013.4659", "10.1177/1753193409348185", "10.1179/000870403235002042", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744199", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2539960", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.193", "10.1145/2470654.2481374", "10.5220/0006127502170224", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598618", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2468292", "10.1109/vast.2015.7347624", "10.1111/cgf.12390", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.110", "10.1145/1168149.1168158", "10.1109/pacificvis.2012.6183556", "10.2106/jbjs.j.01348", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03092.x", "10.1145/203356.203365", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.162", "10.1111/dmcn.12490", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.139", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744319", "10.1145/3011077.3011095", "10.1007/978-0-85729-079-3"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1139, "embedding": [0.5563333034515381, 0.3171690106391907, 0.9671328663825989, 0.27826863527297974, -0.6415178775787354, 0.16650904715061188, 0.025421539321541786, 1.0764894485473633, -0.4787178039550781, -0.9009531736373901, 0.39648860692977905, -0.2865946292877197, -0.15792734920978546, 0.187674418091774, 0.31854701042175293, 0.6091771125793457, -0.11211740970611572, 0.06589167565107346, -0.7424624562263489, 0.16818372905254364, -0.06630208343267441, 1.2829711437225342, -0.4724594056606293, -0.15392345190048218, -0.6446452736854553, 0.05785536766052246, -0.5536867380142212, -0.12362419068813324, 0.5355137586593628, 0.9282567501068115, -0.03555615246295929, 0.4110714793205261], "projection": [-4.511495590209961, 5.747219562530518], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
