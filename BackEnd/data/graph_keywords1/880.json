It reveals clusters of high-dimensional data points at different scales while only requiring minimal tuning of its parameters. However, the computational complexity of the algorithm limits its application to relatively small datasets. To address this problem, several evolutions of t-SNE have been developed in recent years, mainly focusing on the scalability of the similarity computations between data points. However, these contributions are insufficient to achieve interactive rates when visualizing the evolution of the t-SNE embedding for large datasets. In this work, we present a novel approach to the minimization of the t-SNE objective function that heavily relies on graphics hardware and has linear computational complexity. Our technique decreases the computational cost of running t-SNE on datasets by orders of magnitude and retains or improves on the accuracy of past approximated techniques. We propose to approximate the repulsive forces between data points by splatting kernel textures for each data point. This approximation allows us to reformulate the t-SNE minimization problem as a series of tensor operations that can be efficiently executed on the graphics card. An efficient implementation of our technique is integrated and available for use in the widely used Google TensorFlow.js, and an open-source C++ library.", "keywords": "High Dimensional Data,Dimensionality Reduction,Progressive Visual Analytics,Approximate Computation,GPGPU", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934307", "refList": ["10.1111/cgf.12893", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2570755", "10.23915/distill.00015", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742387", "10.1109/cvpr.2015.7298594", "10.1111/cgf.12878", "10.1038/324446a0", "10.1214/aoms/1177704711", "10.1186/s12911-018-0630-x", "10.1080/01638539809545028", "10.1038/nature14539", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745141", "10.1109/cahpc.2018.8645912", "10.1038/ni.3006", "10.1111/j.1365-2583.2011.01088.x", "10.1145/2872427.2883041", "10.1038/nbt.2594", "10.1109/tpami.2014.2321376", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744718", "10.1109/sbac-pad.2018.00060", "10.1145/3065386", "10.3115/v1/d14-1162", "10.1038/nature14236", "10.1016/j.neucom.2014.07.073", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346574", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744358", "10.1214/aoms/1177728190", "10.1038/s41467-017-01689-9"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2020.3030459", "title": "Scalability of Network Visualisation from a Cognitive Load Perspective", "year": "2020", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Vahan Yoghourdjian;Yalong Yang;Tim Dwyer;Lawrence Lee;Michael Wybrow;Kim Marriott", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Yoghourdjian, V (Corresponding Author), Monash Univ, Fac Informat Technol, Dept Human Ctr Comp, Melbourne, Vic, Australia.

However, even the best network layout algorithms ultimately result in \u2018hairball\u2019 visualisations when the graph reaches a certain degree of complexity, requiring simplification through aggregation or interaction (such as filtering) to remain usable. Until now, there has been little data to indicate at what level of complexity node-link diagrams become ineffective or how visual complexity affects cognitive load. To this end, we conducted a controlled study to understand workload limits for a task that requires a detailed understanding of the network topology-finding the shortest path between two nodes. We tested performance on graphs with 25 to 175 nodes with varying density. We collected performance measures (accuracy and response time), subjective feedback, and physiological measures (EEG, pupil dilation, and heart rate variability). To the best of our knowledge this is the first network visualisation study to include physiological measures. Our results show that people have significant difficulty finding the shortest path in high density node-link diagrams with more than 50 nodes and even low density graphs with more than 100 nodes. From our collected EEG data we observe functional differences in brain activity between hard and easy tasks. We found that cognitive load increased up to certain level of difficulty after which it decreased, likely because participants had given up. We also explored the effects of global network layout features such as size or number of crossings, and features of the shortest path such as length or straightness on task difficulty. We found that global features generally had a greater impact than those of the shortest path.", "keywords": "Data Visualisation,Network Visualisation,Cognitive Load,EEG", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030459", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934396", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598867", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2570755", "10.1007/s00371-013-0892-3", "10.1007/b98835", "10.1109/isda.2014.7066252", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467251", "10.1177/1473871612455749", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.299", "10.1007/3-540-58950-3", "10.1111/cgf.12878", "10.1109/mcse.2007.55", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.238", "10.1145/264645.264657", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467451", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.151", "10.1016/0020-0190(89)90102-6", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934307", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2468151", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745919", "10.3402/qhw.v6i2.5918", "10.1111/cgf.13440", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.220", "10.1111/cgf.13187", "10.1109/t-c.1969.222678", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2743858", "10.1126/science.290.5500.2319", "10.1109/cahpc.2018.8645912", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2465151", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598958", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2751473", "10.1002/spe.4380211102", "10.1109/tpds.2018.2869805", "10.1016/j.jpdc.2019.04.008", "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031574", "10.1006/s1045-926x(02)00016-2", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2674999", "10.1145/2872427.2883041", "10.1145/3292500.3330989", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744878", "10.1145/2049662.2049670", "10.1145/2049662.2049663", "10.1109/sbac-pad.2018.00060", "10.1007/978-3-662-45803-7\\_27", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742389", "10.1371/journal.pone.0098679", "10.1111/j.1469-1809.1936.tb02137.x", "10.1007/bf02289565", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2689016", "10.1007/3-540-63938-1\\_"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 880, "embedding": [0.2238524854183197, 0.4085088074207306, 0.34856346249580383, 0.8407905697822571, -0.6602144837379456, 0.16650904715061188, 0.39170947670936584, 1.4677438735961914, -0.43060755729675293, -0.7726082801818848, 0.08888346701860428, -0.09592056274414062, -0.13366082310676575, 0.5559507608413696, 0.25980523228645325, 0.8352559804916382, -0.18767276406288147, 0.06482167541980743, -0.6607173681259155, 0.3837868869304657, -0.06630208343267441, 1.7205846309661865, -0.42647549510002136, -0.1414090394973755, -0.3453308939933777, 0.08472851663827896, -0.5077023506164551, -0.17138656973838806, 0.9095917344093323, 0.3238603472709656, -0.03950650990009308, 0.45873749256134033], "projection": [-4.562453269958496, 6.072270393371582], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
