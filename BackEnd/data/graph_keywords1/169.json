We propose a novel TF design toolbox based on color similarity which is used to adjust opacity as well as replacing colors. We show that both CIE L{*}u{*}v{*} chromaticity and the chroma component of YCBCR are equally suited as underlying color space for the TF widgets. In order to maximize the area utilized in the TF editor, we renormalize the color space based on the histogram of the dataset. Thereby, colors representing a high er share of the dataset are depicted more prominently, thus providing a higher sensitivity for fine-tuning TF widgets. The applicability of our TF design toolbox is demonstrated by volume ray casting challenging full-color volume data including the visible male cryosection dataset and examples from 3D histology.", "keywords": "Computer Graphics {[}I.3.3]: Picture/Image Generation-Display algorithms Computer Graphics; {[}I.3.6]: Methodology and Techniques Computer Graphics; {[}I. 3.7] : ThreeDimensional Graphics and Realism Computer Graphics; {[}I.3.8]: Applications", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2017.8031591", "refList": ["10.1145/1375714.1375729", "10.1109/tbme.2014.2303294", "10.1109/tvcg.2002.1021579", "10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.01.033", "10.1109/icpr.1990.118220", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.240", "10.2312/vissym/vissym02/115-124", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.231", "10.1109/visual.2001.964519", "10.1038/srep12096", "10.1109/visual.2003.1250413", "10.1109/2945.998670", "10.4103/2153-3539.151890", "10.1109/pccga.2002.1167880"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864816", "title": "Interactive Visualization of 3D Histopathology in Native Resolution", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Martin Falk;Anders Ynnerman;Darren Treanor;Claes Lundstr\u00f6m", "citationCount": "1", "affiliation": "Falk, M (Corresponding Author), Linkoping Univ, Dept Sci \\& Technol, Linkoping, Sweden.

Clinical work flows and research based on pathology have, until now, largely been dominated by 2D imaging. As we will show in the paper, studying volumetric histology data will open up novel and useful opportunities for both research and clinical practice. Our starting point is the current lack of appropriate visualization tools in histopathology, which has been a limiting factor in the uptake of digital pathology. Visualization of 3D histology data does pose difficult challenges in several aspects. The full-color datasets are dense and large in scale, on the order of 100,000 \u00d7 100,000 \u00d7 100 voxels. This entails serious demands on both rendering performance and user experience design. Despite this, our developed application supports interactive study of 3D histology datasets at native resolution. Our application is based on tailoring and tuning of existing methods, system integration work, as well as a careful study of domain specific demands emanating from a close participatory design process with domain experts as team members. Results from a user evaluation employing the tool demonstrate a strong agreement among the 14 participating pathologists that 3D histopathology will be a valuable and enabling tool for their work.", "keywords": "Histology,Pathology,Volume Rendering,Expert Evaluation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864816", "refList": ["10.4103/2153-3539.129452", "10.2312/vissym/vissym02/115-124", "10.1371/journal.pone.0126817", "10.1093/ajcp/138.suppl1.288", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.150", "10.4103/2153-3539.151890", "10.1109/mcg.2010.26", "10.1109/tbme.2014.2303294", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.240", "10.1111/cgf.12605", "10.1007/s00371-008-0261-9", "10.1109/tvcg.2002.1021579", "10.1016/j.mri.2012.05.001", "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031591", "10.1111/his.12629", "10.2312/vissym/vissym00/137-146", "10.4103/2153-3539.151894", "10.1186/s12859-017-1934-z", "10.1117/12.813756", "10.1145/2834117", "10.1111/his.13452", "10.1111/cgf.12934", "10.1001/jama.2017.14585", "10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.01.033", "10.1109/visual.2002.1183757", "10.4103/2153-3539.114206", "10.17629/www.diagnosticpathology.eu-2016-2:232", "10.1109/mcg.2013.55", "10.1073/pnas.1710742114", "10.1117/12.529137", "10.2312/vg/vg-pbg08/163-170", "10.4103/2153-3539.119005"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 169, "embedding": [0.35711443424224854, 0.01104410458356142, 0.5392378568649292, -0.48394671082496643, -0.6896921992301941, 0.16650904715061188, 0.414119690656662, 1.3241633176803589, -0.4727596938610077, -0.7778310179710388, 0.11740081012248993, -0.7360262870788574, -0.15391238033771515, 0.11259564757347107, 0.7290737628936768, 0.35308727622032166, -0.025036709383130074, 0.06749609857797623, -0.7390042543411255, -0.006841571070253849, -0.06630208343267441, 0.8973312973976135, -0.5773982405662537, -0.14990495145320892, -1.410144329071045, 0.06111183390021324, -0.561912477016449, -0.027919292449951172, -0.06697691231966019, 1.6433390378952026, -0.31478241086006165, 0.2093086838722229], "projection": [-4.749096870422363, 5.59552526473999], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
