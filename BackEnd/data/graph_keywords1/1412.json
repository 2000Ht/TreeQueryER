We contribute findings from several studies examining visualization sequencing and reception. In our first study, people made decisions between various possible structures as they ordered a set of related visualizations (consisting of either bar charts or thematic maps) into what they considered the clearest sequence for showing the data. We find that most people structure visualization sequences hierarchically: they create high level groupings based on shared data properties like time period, measure, level of aggregation, and spatial region, then order the views within these groupings. We also observe a tendency for certain types of similarities between views, like a common spatial region or aggregation level, to be seen as more appropriate categories for organizing views in a sequence than others, like a common time period or measure. In a second study, we find that viewers' perceptions of the quality and intention of different sequences are largely consistent with the perceptions of the users who created them. The understanding of sequence preferences and perceptions that emerges from our studies has implications for the development of visualization authoring tools and sequence recommendations for guided analysis.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13194", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2008.137", "10.2307/2287576", "10.1145/1142473.1142574", "10.1145/2702123.2702431", "10.1016/0010-0285(77)90005-6", "10.1111/j.1467-9280.1995.tb00513.x", "10.1016/s0022-5371(78)90164-0", "10.1137/0906011", "10.3758/bf03201236", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.119", "10.1111/cogs.12016", "10.1007/s10339-010-0379-3", "10.1016/0010-0285(77)90006-8", "10.1016/j.physrep.2009.11.002", "10.1145/2133416.2146416", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467191", "10.1080/741941434", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.179", "10.1016/s0022-5371(79)90173-7", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.255"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00036", "year": "2019", "title": "Designing Narrative Slideshows for Learning Analytics", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Qing Chen;Zhen Li;Ting{-}Chuen Pong;Huamin Qu", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Chen, Q (Corresponding Author), Hong Kong Univ Sci \\& Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.\nChen, Qing; Li, Zhen; Pong, Ting-Chuen; Qu, Huamin, Hong Kong Univ Sci \\& Technol, Hong Kong, Peoples R China.", "countries": "China", "abstract": "The practical power of data visualization is currently attracting much attention in the e-learning domain. A growing number of studies have been conducted in recent years to help instructors better analyze learner behavior and reflect on their teaching. However, current e-learning dashboards and visualization systems usually require a lot of time and effort into the exploration process. Moreover, the lack of communication power of existing systems constrains users from organizing the narrative of information pieces into a compelling data story. In this paper, we have proposed a narrative visualization approach with an interactive slideshow that helps instructors and education experts explore potential learning patterns and convey data stories. This approach contains three key components: guided-tour concept, drill-down path, and dig-in exploration dimension. The use cases further demonstrate the potential of employing this visual narrative approach in the e-learning context.", "keywords": "Human-centered computing; Visualization; Visualization application domains; Information Visualization", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PacificVis.2019.00036", "refList": ["10.1145/2723576.2723662", "10.1111/cgf.13195", "10.1145/2702123.2702431", "10.1007/s00779-013-0751-2", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2505305", "10.1109/pacificvis.2015.7156373", "10.1145/2212776.2212860", "10.1145/2858036.2858387", "10.1109/mcg.2015.99", "10.1016/j.chb.2014.07.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.119", "10.1111/cogs.12016", "10.1016/j.chb.2014.05.045", "10.1111/cgf.13194", "10.1007/978-3-319-66610-5\\_10", "10.1145/2090116.2090118", "10.1145/2460296.2460350", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70577", "10.1007/978-3-319-13296-9\\_16", "10.1145/3027385.3027403", "10.1145/2723576.2723627", "10.1145/2724660.2724683", "10.3928/00220124-20121227-69", "10.1145/3027385.3027451", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.179", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70584", "10.1109/tlt.2016.2599522", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.255"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1412, "embedding": [0.21605096757411957, 0.9946518540382385, 0.6342852711677551, 1.0937670469284058, -0.6415178775787354, 0.16650904715061188, -0.5011782050132751, 1.9664263725280762, -0.4787178039550781, -0.9009531736373901, 0.13232851028442383, 1.166197419166565, -0.15792734920978546, 2.448643684387207, 1.0950766801834106, 0.8115677833557129, -0.022274399176239967, 0.06589167565107346, -0.7424624562263489, -0.9167535305023193, -0.06630208343267441, 1.837942123413086, 0.23529364168643951, -0.15392345190048218, 0.7125094532966614, 0.05785536766052246, -0.5536867380142212, 0.5217792987823486, 2.091456174850464, -1.2530934810638428, 0.4289344847202301, 1.070762276649475], "projection": [-4.57156229019165, 7.581133842468262], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
