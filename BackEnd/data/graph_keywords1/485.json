This paper illustrates the development of a visual analytics profiling system that is used to address such research questions. Taking musicological knowledge into account, we outline various steps of our collaborative digital humanities project, priority (1) the definition of various measures to determine the similarity of musicians' attributes, and (2) the design of an interactive profiling system that supports musicologists in iteratively determining similar musicians.

Through the inclusion of patient-specific data, such simulations may facilitate personalized treatment and customized surgical interventions. Difficulties in spine modelling and simulation can be partly attributed to poor result representation, which may also be a hindrance when introducing such techniques into a clinical environment.

These language models are typified by a pre-training process on large unlabeled text corpora and subsequently fine-tuned for specific tasks. Although considerable work has been devoted to understanding the attention mechanisms of pre-trained models, it is less understood how a model's attention mechanisms change when trained for a target NLP task. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach to understanding fine-tuning in attention-based language models. Our visualization, Attention Flows, is designed to support users in querying, tracing, and comparing attention within layers, across layers, and amongst attention heads in Transformer-based language models. To help users gain insight on how a classification decision is made, our design is centered on depicting classification-based attention at the deepest layer and how attention from prior layers flows throughout words in the input. Attention Flows supports the analysis of a single model, as well as the visual comparison between pre-trained and fine-tuned models via their similarities and differences. We use Attention Flows to study attention mechanisms in various sentence understanding tasks and highlight how attention evolves to address the nuances of solving these tasks.", "keywords": "NLP,Transformer,Visual Analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3028976", "refList": ["10.1093/bib/bbx108", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346435", "10.1093/bioinformatics/btp033", "10.1016/0022-2836(70)90057-4", "10.1093/llc/fqt032", "10.1109/icpr.2018.8545064", "10.1109/pacificvis.2015.7156366", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1093/llc/18.1.101", "10.1109/iccv.2015.507", "10.1093/llc/fqu007", "10.1093/llc/fqx024", "10.1109/jcdl.2014.6970166", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.124", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.96", "10.1016/j.ijhcs.2009.02.001", "10.1111/cgf.12618", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467618", "10.1109/vast.2017.8585505", "10.1109/icdar.2013.39", "10.1145/1378889.1378892", "10.1111/cgf.12798", "10.1093/llc/fqt046", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.232", "10.1093/library/19.4.514", "10.1107/s0907444909007835", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.172", "10.1179/000870403235002042"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 9}, {"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00038", "year": "2019", "title": "An Interactive Chart of Biography", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Richard Khulusi;Jakob Kusnick;Josef Focht;Stefan J{\\\"{a}}nicke", "citationCount": "1", "affiliation": "", "countries": "germany", "abstract": "Joseph Priestley's Chart of Biography is a masterpiece of hand-drawn data visualization. He arranged the lifespans of around 2,000 individuals on a timeline, and the chart obtained great value for teaching purposes. We present a generic, interactive variant of the chart adopting Priestley's basic design principles. Our proposed visualization allows for dynamically defining person groups to be visually compared on different zoom levels. We designed the visualization in cooperation with musicologists having multifaceted research interests on a biographical database of musicians. On the one hand, we enable deriving new relationships between musicians in order to extend the underlying database, and on the other hand, our visualization supports analyzing time-dependent changes of musical institutions.

A typical CV is comprised of multiple sections associated with spatio-temporal, nominal, hierarchical, and ordinal data. The main task of a recruiter is, given a job application with specific requirements, to compare and assess CVs in order to build a short list of promising candidates to interview. Commonly, this is done by viewing CVs in a side-by-side fashion. This becomes challenging when comparing more than two CVs, because the reader is required to switch attention between them. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that the CVs are structured similarly, thus making the overview cluttered and significantly slowing down the comparison process. In order to address these challenges, in this paper we propose CV3, an interactive exploration environment offering users a new way to explore, assess, and compare multiple CVs, to suggest suitable candidates for specific job requirements. We validate our system by means of domain expert feedback whose results highlight both the efficacy of our approach and its limitations. We learned that CV3 eases the overall burden of recruiters thereby assisting them in the selection process.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13675", "refList": ["10.1145/245129.245134", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467971", "10.1145/3025453.3025628", "10.1109/cmv.2007.20", "10.1007/978-3-319-66610-5\\_26", "10.1109/2945.841119", "10.1016/j.cag.2013.11.002", "10.1093/comjnl/bxx117", "10.1109/38.689657", "10.1007/3-540-31190-4", "10.1007/bf01954291", "10.1145/3230707", "10.1007/s10961-006-7203-3", "10.1145/102377.115768", "10.1007/978-0-85729-079-3\\_8", "10.1145/1056018.1056041", "10.1109/infvis.2004.1", "10.17697/ibmrd/2014/v3i1/46706", "10.1109/infvis.2001.963285", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2520921", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467620", "10.1007/bf01187665", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.111", "10.1016/j.respol.2004.01.005", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2614803"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 15}, "index": 485, "embedding": [0.19396765530109406, 0.9229608178138733, -1.0254276990890503, -0.0664413794875145, -0.6602144837379456, 0.16650904715061188, -0.706787109375, 1.8878382444381714, -0.3147187829017639, 1.0080397129058838, 0.26387274265289307, -0.2433338463306427, 0.6180228590965271, 0.799534022808075, -0.7231093645095825, 1.317769169807434, -0.17059768736362457, 2.0692574977874756, -0.6607173681259155, 2.853424310684204, -0.06630208343267441, 1.9111915826797485, -0.7379782199859619, 1.397763729095459, -2.4643778800964355, 1.8689522743225098, -0.5077023506164551, 0.2631162106990814, 1.6340597867965698, -0.909396767616272, -0.0947735458612442, 0.9183606505393982], "projection": [-0.786016047000885, 7.927731513977051], "size": 8, "height": 4, "width": 3}
