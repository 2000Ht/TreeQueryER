Though, many practical applications go beyond the study of the vector field. Instead, engineers seek to understand the behavior of inertial particles moving therein, for instance in sediment transport, helicopter brownout and pulverized coal combustion. In this paper, we present two strategies for the extraction of the corelines that inertial particles swirl around, which depend on particle density, particle diameter, fluid viscosity and gravity. The first is to deduce the local swirling behavior from the autonomous inertial motion ODE, which eventually reduces to a parallel vectors operation. For the second strategy, we use a particle density estimation to locate inertial attractors. With this, we are able to extract the cores of swirling inertial particle motion for both steady and unsteady 3D vector fields. We demonstrate our techniques in a number of benchmark data sets, and elaborate on the relation to traditional massless corelines.", "keywords": "Inertial particles, flow visualization, vortex cores", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2014.2346415", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2007.70633", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1103/physreve.80.066318", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_1", "10.1109/2945.468404", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_4", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1175/1520-0493(2002)130", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.198", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2003.00723.x", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1053", "10.1175/1520-0493(2004)132", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03096.x"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "title": "Rotation Invariant Vortices for Flow Visualization", "year": "2015", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Tobias G\u00fcnther;Maik Schulze;Holger Theisel", "citationCount": "18", "affiliation": "Gunther, T (Corresponding Author), Univ Magdeburg, Visual Comp Grp, D-39106 Magdeburg, Germany.

In this work, we focus on the linear correlation and non-linear dependency of different physical attributes of unsteady flows to aid their study from a new perspective. Specifically, we extend the existing spatial correlation quantification, i.e. the Local Correlation Coefficient (LCC), to the spatio-temporal domain to study the correlation of attribute-pairs from both the Eulerian and Lagrangian views. To study the dependency among attributes, which need not be linear, we extend and compute the mutual information (MI) among attributes over time. To help visualize and interpret the derived correlation and dependency among attributes associated with a particle, we encode the correlation and dependency values on individual pathlines. Finally, to utilize the correlation and MI computation results to identify regions with interesting flow behavior, we propose a segmentation strategy of the flow domain based on the ranking of the strength of the attributes relations.

Our approach uses techniques that examine the intrinsic geometry of manifolds through their heat kernel, to obtain representations of such manifolds that are isometry-invariant and multi-scale. These representations permit us to compute heat kernel signatures of each point on that manifold, and we can use these signatures as features for classification and segmentation that identify points that have similar structural properties. Our approach adapts heat kernel signatures to unsteady flows by formulating a notion of shape where pathlines are observations of a manifold living in a high-dimensional space. We use this space to compute and visualize heat kernel signatures associated with each pathline. Besides being able to capture the structural features of a pathline, heat kernel signatures allow the comparison of pathlines from different flow datasets through a shape matching pipeline. We demonstrate the analytic power of heat kernel signatures by comparing both (1) different timesteps from the same unsteady flow as well as (2) flow datasets taken from ensemble simulations with varying simulation parameters. Our analysis only requires the pathlines themselves, and thus it does not utilize the underlying vector field directly. We make minimal assumptions on the pathlines: while we assume they are sampled from a continuous, unsteady flow, our computations can tolerate pathlines that have varying density and potential unknown boundaries.

These challenges include dealing with extremely large volumes of multidimensional data, supporting interactive visual analysis, ensembles exploration and visualization, exploring model sensitivities to inputs, mesoscale ocean features analysis, predictive analytics, heterogeneity and complexity of observational data, representing uncertainty, and many more. Researchers across disciplines collaborate to address such challenges, which led to significant research and development advances in ocean and atmospheric sciences, and also in several relevant areas such as visualization and visual analytics, big data analytics, machine learning and statistics. In this report, we perform an extensive survey of research advances in the visual analysis of ocean and atmospheric datasets. First, we survey the task requirements by conducting interviews with researchers, domain experts, and end users working with these datasets on a spectrum of analytics problems in the domain of ocean and atmospheric sciences. We then discuss existing models and frameworks related to data analysis, sense-making, and knowledge discovery for visual analytics applications. We categorize the techniques, systems, and tools presented in the literature based on the taxonomies of task requirements, interaction methods, visualization techniques, machine learning and statistical methods, evaluation methods, data types, data dimensions and size, spatial scale and application areas.

The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.", "keywords": "Vortex extraction,inertial particles,objectivity,vortex coreline", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828", "refList": ["10.1016/0377-0257(79)87004-4", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1016/0167-2789(91)90088-q", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70633", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_9", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1017/s002211209900467x", "10.1143/jpsj.66.1331", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1017/s0022112092001460", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01238.x", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/visual.1997.663910", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1146/annurev.fluid.23.1.601", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "10.1145/1057432.1057452", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1007/s100219900068", "10.2514/2.744", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1016/0960-0779(94)90137-6", "10.1016/0010-4655(88)90020-3", "10.1109/visual.1991.175773", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1016/j.ijengsci.2007.10.005", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.11", "10.1111/cgf.13439", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1145/2897824.2925919", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0011-7471(70)90059-8", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1053"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13689", "year": "2019", "title": "Robust Reference Frame Extraction from Unsteady 2D Vector Fields with Convolutional Neural Networks", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Byungsoo Kim;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Kim, B (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nKim, Byungsoo; Guenther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Robust feature extraction is an integral part of scientific visualization.

In this paper, we utilize a convolutional neural network to combine two steps of the visualization pipeline in an end-to-end manner: the filtering and the feature extraction. We use neural networks for the extraction of a steady reference frame for a given unsteady 2D vector field. By conditioning the neural network to noisy inputs and resampling artifacts, we obtain numerically stabler results than existing optimization-based approaches. Supervised deep learning typically requires a large amount of training data. Thus, our second contribution is the creation of a vector field benchmark data set, which is generally useful for any local deep learning-based feature extraction. Based on Vatistas velocity profile, we formulate a parametric vector field mixture model that we parameterize based on numerically-computed example vector fields in near-steady reference frames.

At present, visualization is mainly applied to explore and explain neural networks. Its counterpart-the application of deep learning to visualization problems-requires us to share data more openly in order to enable more scientists to engage in data-driven research. In this paper, we construct a large fluid flow data set and apply it to a deep learning problem in scientific visualization. Parameterized by the Reynolds number, the data set contains a wide spectrum of laminar and turbulent fluid flow regimes. The full data set was simulated on a high-performance compute cluster and contains 8000 time-dependent 2D vector fields, accumulating to more than 16 TB in size.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.", "keywords": "Deep neural network,3D cerebrovascular segmentation and visualization,maximum intensity projection (MIP),joint embedding", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030374", "refList": ["10.1109/cluster.2018.00036", "10.1109/iccv.2015.123", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.133", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.19", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934312", "10.1007/978-3-319-46487-9\\_40", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.175", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70523", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2880207", "10.1145/3309993", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00018", "10.1109/iccv.2017.244", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.632", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816059", "10.1109/pacificvis.2009.4906852", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864808", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2881523", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467431", "10.1109/tpami.2015.2439281", "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.8737", "10.1109/cvpr.2019.00244", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.165", "10.1109/bigdata.2018.8622520", "10.1007/978-3-319-46466-4\\_29", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933759", "10.1145/3197517.3201304", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742378", "10.1109/cvpr.2006.91", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742369", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934255", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4\\_28", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00041", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934332", "10.1109/cvpr.2018.00916", "10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6\\_43"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}], "len": 7}], "len": 9}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864839", "title": "Time-Dependent Flow seen through Approximate Observer Killing Fields", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Markus Hadwiger;Matej Mlejnek;Thomas Theu\u00dfl;Peter Rautek", "citationCount": "5", "affiliation": "Hadwiger, M (Corresponding Author), KAUST, Visual Comp Ctr, Thuwal 239556900, Saudi Arabia.

However, often no global frame can depict all flow features equally well. Likewise, objective criteria for detecting features such as vortices often use either a global reference frame, or compute a separate frame for each point in space and time. We propose the first general framework that enables choosing a smooth trade-off between these two extremes. Using global optimization to minimize specific differential geometric properties, we compute a time-dependent observer velocity field that describes the motion of a continuous field of observers adapted to the input flow. This requires developing the novel notion of an observed time derivative. While individual observers are restricted to rigid motions, overall we compute an approximate Killing field, corresponding to almost-rigid motion. This enables continuous transitions between different observers. Instead of focusing only on flow features, we furthermore develop a novel general notion of visualizing how all observers jointly perceive the input field. This in fact requires introducing the concept of an observation time, with respect to which a visualization is computed. We develop the corresponding notions of observed stream, path, streak, and time lines. For efficiency, these characteristic curves can be computed using standard approaches, by first transforming the input field accordingly. Finally, we prove that the input flow perceived by the observer field is objective. This makes derived flow features, such as vortices, objective as well.", "keywords": "Flow visualization,observer frames of reference,Killing vector fields,infinitesimal isometries,Lie derivatives,objectivity", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864839", "refList": ["10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03063.x", "10.1109/embc.2013.6610171", "10.1111/cgf.13319", "10.1145/1239451.1239515", "10.1109/visual.1997.663898", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1145/2723158", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2010.01779.x", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1111/cgf.12174", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.163", "10.1145/1276377.1276457", "10.1109/tvcg.2002.1021575", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1109/pacificvis.2016.7465253", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.198", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.02028.x", "10.1145/1073204.1073323", "10.1111/cgf.12427", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.316", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70557", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2312012"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934375", "title": "Vector Field Topology of Time-Dependent Flows in a Steady Reference Frame", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Irene Baeza Rojo;Tobias G\u00fcnther", "citationCount": "2", "affiliation": "Rojo, IB (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Comp Graph Lab, Zurich, Switzerland.

To this end, we expand on recent local optimization approaches by modeling spatially-varying deformations through displacement transformations from continuum mechanics. We compare and discuss the relationships with existing local and integration-based topology extraction methods, showing for instance that separatrices seeded from saddles in the optimal frame align with the integration-based streakline vector field topology. In contrast to the streakline-based approach, our method gives a complete picture of the topology for every time slice, including the steps near the temporal domain boundaries.

The five most important properties identified in the existing literature include coincidence with the steady case, induction of a partition within the domain, Lagrangian invariance, objectivity, and Galilean invariance.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.14037", "refList": ["10.2514/6.1995-1715", "10.1111/cgf.12100", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_1", "10.1111/cgf.12885", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934312", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.92", "10.1063/1.166399", "10.1109/tvcg.2005.68.3", "10.1063/1.4971788", "10.1111/cgf.12933", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1063/1.4982720", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864432", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.93", "10.1109/pacificvis.2016.7465253", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864505", "10.1063/1.858828", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934255", "10.5194/npg-9-237-2002", "10.1063/1.4800210", "10.1007/978-3-540-88606-8\\_12", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01942.x", "10.1109/2945.928168", "10.1007/978-3-662-10388-31", "10.1016/j.physd.2013.01.013", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1017/s002211209900720x", "10.1017/s0022112097008057", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01546.x", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03089.x", "10.1111/cgf.13319", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934375.3", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002.4", "10.1016/s0167-2789(00)00142-1", "10.1111/cgf.12359", "10.1103/physreve.93.063107", "10.1016/j.physd.2009.05.005", "10.1063/1.1477449", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01686.x", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742374", "10.1017/jfm.2013.391", "10.1111/cgf.12121", "10.1186/1743-422x-3-15", "10.1063/1.3502450", "10.1063/1.868323", "10.1016/j.cnsns.2013.05.002", "10.1109/visual.2004.99", "10.1109/visual.2004.107", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01604.x", "10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141322", "10.1063/1.3690153", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934375", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.143", "10.1137/130940633", "10.1016/j.cag.2014.01.007", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1109/vl.1996.545307", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.284", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.265", "10.1017/jfm.2016.792", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.208", "10.1007/s12650-016-0348-8", "10.1023/b:elas.0000005548.36767.e7", "10.1007/978-1-4939-0419-8\\_\\_9", "10.1007/bf00849110", "10.1615/int.j.uncertaintyquantification.2012003956", "10.1017/s0022112096001802", "10.1017/s0962492902000065", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00041", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01901.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.33", "10.1016/j.physd.2005.10.007", "10.1016/s0894-1777(96)00090-8", "10.1145/2517327.2442526", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2743938", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816059", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934242", "10.2514/6.1995-1715.4", "10.1111/cgf.12109", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.269", "10.1109/visual.1990.146359", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2003.00723.x", "10.5194/npg-18-977-2011", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70557", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2312012"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13982", "year": "2020", "title": "Extraction of Distinguished Hyperbolic Trajectories for 2D Time-Dependent Vector Field Topology", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Lutz Hofmann;Filip Sadlo", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Hofmann, L (Corresponding Author), Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany.\nHofmann, Lutz; Sadlo, Filip, Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany.", "countries": "Germany", "abstract": "This paper does two main contributions to 2D time-dependent vector field topology.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.", "keywords": "Deep neural network,3D cerebrovascular segmentation and visualization,maximum intensity projection (MIP),joint embedding", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030374", "refList": ["10.1109/cluster.2018.00036", "10.1109/iccv.2015.123", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.133", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.19", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934312", "10.1007/978-3-319-46487-9\\_40", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.175", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70523", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2880207", "10.1145/3309993", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00018", "10.1109/iccv.2017.244", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.632", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816059", "10.1109/pacificvis.2009.4906852", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864808", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2881523", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467431", "10.1109/tpami.2015.2439281", "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.8737", "10.1109/cvpr.2019.00244", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.165", "10.1109/bigdata.2018.8622520", "10.1007/978-3-319-46466-4\\_29", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933759", "10.1145/3197517.3201304", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742378", "10.1109/cvpr.2006.91", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742369", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934255", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4\\_28", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00041", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934332", "10.1109/cvpr.2018.00916", "10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6\\_43"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}], "len": 7}], "len": 15}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934310", "title": "Extraction and Visual Analysis of Potential Vorticity Banners around the Alps", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Robin Bader;Michael Sprenger;Nikolina Ban;Stefan R\u00fcdis\u00fchli;Christoph Sch\u00e4r;Tobias G\u00fcnther", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Bader, R (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.

For instance, potential vorticity plays a key role in particularly strong wind peaks in extratropical cyclones and it is able to explain the occurrence of frontal rain bands. Potential vorticity combines the key quantities of atmospheric dynamics, namely rotation and stratification. Under suitable wind conditions elongated banners of potential vorticity appear in the lee of mountains. Their role in atmospheric dynamics has recently raised considerable interest in the meteorological community for instance due to their influence in aviation wind hazards and maritime transport. In order to support meteorologists and climatologists in the analysis of these structures, we developed an extraction algorithm and a visual exploration framework consisting of multiple linked views. For the extraction we apply a predictor-corrector algorithm that follows streamlines and realigns them with extremal lines of potential vorticity. Using the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm, we group banners from different sources based on their proximity. To visually analyze the time-dependent banner geometry, we provide interactive overviews and enable the query for detail on demand, including the analysis of different time steps, potentially correlated scalar quantities, and the wind vector field. In particular, we study the relationship between relative humidity and the banners for their potential in indicating the development of precipitation.

We build up on recent work on vortex extraction to define a time-dependent vector field topology for 2D and 3D flows.

To this end, we expand on recent local optimization approaches by modeling spatially-varying deformations through displacement transformations from continuum mechanics. We compare and discuss the relationships with existing local and integration-based topology extraction methods, showing for instance that separatrices seeded from saddles in the optimal frame align with the integration-based streakline vector field topology. In contrast to the streakline-based approach, our method gives a complete picture of the topology for every time slice, including the steps near the temporal domain boundaries. With our work it now becomes possible to extract topological information even when only few time slices are available.

Second, we provide a detailed evaluation and discussion of previous approaches for the extraction of DHTs and time-dependent vector field topology in general.

In unsteady flows, the dynamics of tracer particles have been extensively studied by the extraction of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS), such as hyperbolic LCS as ridges of the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE). The extension of the rich LCS framework to inertial particles is currently a hot topic in the CFD literature and is actively under research. Recently, backward FTLE on tracer particles has been shown to correlate with the preferential particle settling of small inertial particles. For larger particles, inertial trajectories may deviate strongly from (massless) tracer trajectories, and thus for a better agreement, backward FTLE should be computed on inertial trajectories directly. Inertial backward integration, however, has not been possible until the recent introduction of the influence curve concept, which - given an observation and an initial velocity - allows to recover all sources of inertial particles as tangent curves of a derived vector field. In this paper, we show that FTLE on the influence curve vector field is in agreement with preferential particle settling and more importantly it is not only valid for small (near-tracer) particles. We further generalize the influence curve concept to general equations of motion in unsteady spatio-velocity phase spaces, which enables backward integration with more general equations of motion. Applying the influence curve concept to tracer particles in the spatio-velocity domain emits streaklines in massless flows as tangent curves of the influence curve vector field.

The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.", "keywords": "Vortex extraction,inertial particles,objectivity,vortex coreline", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828", "refList": ["10.1016/0377-0257(79)87004-4", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1016/0167-2789(91)90088-q", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70633", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_9", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1017/s002211209900467x", "10.1143/jpsj.66.1331", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1017/s0022112092001460", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01238.x", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/visual.1997.663910", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1146/annurev.fluid.23.1.601", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "10.1145/1057432.1057452", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1007/s100219900068", "10.2514/2.744", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1016/0960-0779(94)90137-6", "10.1016/0010-4655(88)90020-3", "10.1109/visual.1991.175773", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1016/j.ijengsci.2007.10.005", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.11", "10.1111/cgf.13439", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1145/2897824.2925919", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0011-7471(70)90059-8", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1053"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13689", "year": "2019", "title": "Robust Reference Frame Extraction from Unsteady 2D Vector Fields with Convolutional Neural Networks", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Byungsoo Kim;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Kim, B (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nKim, Byungsoo; Guenther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Robust feature extraction is an integral part of scientific visualization.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.", "keywords": "Deep neural network,3D cerebrovascular segmentation and visualization,maximum intensity projection (MIP),joint embedding", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030374", "refList": ["10.1109/cluster.2018.00036", "10.1109/iccv.2015.123", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.133", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.19", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934312", "10.1007/978-3-319-46487-9\\_40", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.175", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70523", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2880207", "10.1145/3309993", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00018", "10.1109/iccv.2017.244", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.632", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816059", "10.1109/pacificvis.2009.4906852", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864808", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2881523", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467431", "10.1109/tpami.2015.2439281", "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.8737", "10.1109/cvpr.2019.00244", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.165", "10.1109/bigdata.2018.8622520", "10.1007/978-3-319-46466-4\\_29", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933759", "10.1145/3197517.3201304", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742378", "10.1109/cvpr.2006.91", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742369", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934255", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4\\_28", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00041", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934332", "10.1109/cvpr.2018.00916", "10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6\\_43"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}], "len": 7}], "len": 9}, {"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13420", "year": "2018", "title": "Visualizing the Phase Space of Heterogeneous Inertial Particles in 2D Flows", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Irene Baeza Rojo;Markus H.

Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs.

Compared to massless particles, the velocity of an inertial particle is not determined solely by its position and time in a vector field. In contrast, its initial velocity can be arbitrary and impacts the dynamics over its entire lifetime. This leads to a four-dimensional problem for 2D setups, and a six-dimensional problem for the 3D case.

The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs. Using our method, users gain deeper insights into the dynamics of inertial particles in 2D fluids, including size-dependent separation, preferential clustering and attraction.

Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.", "keywords": "Vortex extraction,inertial particles,objectivity,vortex coreline", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828", "refList": ["10.1016/0377-0257(79)87004-4", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1016/0167-2789(91)90088-q", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70633", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_9", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1017/s002211209900467x", "10.1143/jpsj.66.1331", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1017/s0022112092001460", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01238.x", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/visual.1997.663910", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1146/annurev.fluid.23.1.601", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "10.1145/1057432.1057452", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1007/s100219900068", "10.2514/2.744", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1016/0960-0779(94)90137-6", "10.1016/0010-4655(88)90020-3", "10.1109/visual.1991.175773", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1016/j.ijengsci.2007.10.005", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.11", "10.1111/cgf.13439", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1145/2897824.2925919", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0011-7471(70)90059-8", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1053"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13689", "year": "2019", "title": "Robust Reference Frame Extraction from Unsteady 2D Vector Fields with Convolutional Neural Networks", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Byungsoo Kim;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Kim, B (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nKim, Byungsoo; Guenther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Robust feature extraction is an integral part of scientific visualization.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons.

In unsteady flows, the dynamics of tracer particles have been extensively studied by the extraction of Lagrangian coherent structures (LCS), such as hyperbolic LCS as ridges of the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE). The extension of the rich LCS framework to inertial particles is currently a hot topic in the CFD literature and is actively under research. Recently, backward FTLE on tracer particles has been shown to correlate with the preferential particle settling of small inertial particles. For larger particles, inertial trajectories may deviate strongly from (massless) tracer trajectories, and thus for a better agreement, backward FTLE should be computed on inertial trajectories directly. Inertial backward integration, however, has not been possible until the recent introduction of the influence curve concept, which - given an observation and an initial velocity - allows to recover all sources of inertial particles as tangent curves of a derived vector field. In this paper, we show that FTLE on the influence curve vector field is in agreement with preferential particle settling and more importantly it is not only valid for small (near-tracer) particles. We further generalize the influence curve concept to general equations of motion in unsteady spatio-velocity phase spaces, which enables backward integration with more general equations of motion. Applying the influence curve concept to tracer particles in the spatio-velocity domain emits streaklines in massless flows as tangent curves of the influence curve vector field.

The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors.

In unsteady vector field analysis, researchers recently directed their attention towards the computation of near-steady reference frames for vortex extraction, which is a numerically challenging endeavor. In this paper, we utilize a convolutional neural network to combine two steps of the visualization pipeline in an end-to-end manner: the filtering and the feature extraction. We use neural networks for the extraction of a steady reference frame for a given unsteady 2D vector field. By conditioning the neural network to noisy inputs and resampling artifacts, we obtain numerically stabler results than existing optimization-based approaches. Supervised deep learning typically requires a large amount of training data. Thus, our second contribution is the creation of a vector field benchmark data set, which is generally useful for any local deep learning-based feature extraction.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.", "keywords": "Deep neural network,3D cerebrovascular segmentation and visualization,maximum intensity projection (MIP),joint embedding", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030374", "refList": ["10.1109/cluster.2018.00036", "10.1109/iccv.2015.123", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.133", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.19", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934312", "10.1007/978-3-319-46487-9\\_40", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.175", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70523", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2880207", "10.1145/3309993", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00018", "10.1109/iccv.2017.244", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.632", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816059", "10.1109/pacificvis.2009.4906852", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864808", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2881523", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467431", "10.1109/tpami.2015.2439281", "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.8737", "10.1109/cvpr.2019.00244", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.165", "10.1109/bigdata.2018.8622520", "10.1007/978-3-319-46466-4\\_29", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933759", "10.1145/3197517.3201304", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742378", "10.1109/cvpr.2006.91", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742369", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934255", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4\\_28", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00041", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934332", "10.1109/cvpr.2018.00916", "10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6\\_43"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}], "len": 7}], "len": 9}, {"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13420", "year": "2018", "title": "Visualizing the Phase Space of Heterogeneous Inertial Particles in 2D Flows", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Irene Baeza Rojo;Markus H.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs.

Our 3D projection maintains a number of useful flow properties, such as critical points and flow maps, and is optimized to match geometric characteristics of the high-dimensional input, as well as optional user constraints. We apply our method to trajectories traced in the phase spaces of second-order dynamical systems, including finite-sized objects in fluids, the circular restricted three-body problem and a damped double pendulum. We compare the projections with standard visualization techniques, such as PCA, t-SNE and UMAP, and visualize the dynamical systems with multiple coordinated views interactively, featuring a spatial embedding, projection to subspaces, our dimensionality reduction and a seed point exploration tool.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13978", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2013.182", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.153", "10.1007/s003710050110", "10.1063/1.2204064", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01958.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.1109/visual.1996.567777", "10.1109/infvis.2004.68", "10.1038/nbt.4314", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.254", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.27", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1162/089976698300017467", "10.1111/cgf.13421", "10.1007/978-3-540-33037-08", "10.1038/s41591-019-0521-4", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.65", "10.1111/cgf.13828", "10.1080/13506280444000102.http://www.uvt.nl/ticc", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.78", "10.1037/h0071325", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1111/cgf.13420", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1109/cahpc.2018.8645912", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.177", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.201", "10.1016/j.arcontrol.2005.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2640960", "10.1007/s11071-005-2790-3", "10.1109/sbac-pad.2018.00060", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467132.3", "10.1007/978-3-540", "10.1088/0034-4885/77/6/065901", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2846735", "10.1007/bf02199365", "10.1007/978-3-540-33037-0\\_8"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 17}, {"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "title": "Topological Analysis of Inertial Dynamics", "year": "2016", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Antoni Sagrist\u00e0;Stefan Jordan;Andreas Just;Fabio Dias;Luis Gustavo Nonato;Filip Sadlo", "citationCount": "7", "affiliation": "Sagrista, A (Corresponding Author), Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to the analysis of the force-induced dynamics of inertial particles. These forces can arise from acceleration fields such as gravitation, but also be dependent on the particle dynamics itself, as in the case of magnetism. Compared to massless particles, the velocity of an inertial particle is not determined solely by its position and time in a vector field. In contrast, its initial velocity can be arbitrary and impacts the dynamics over its entire lifetime. This leads to a four-dimensional problem for 2D setups, and a six-dimensional problem for the 3D case. Our approach avoids this increase in dimensionality and tackles the visualization by an integrated topological analysis approach.

The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.", "keywords": "Vortex extraction,inertial particles,objectivity,vortex coreline", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828", "refList": ["10.1016/0377-0257(79)87004-4", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1016/0167-2789(91)90088-q", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70633", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_9", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1017/s002211209900467x", "10.1143/jpsj.66.1331", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1017/s0022112092001460", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01238.x", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/visual.1997.663910", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1146/annurev.fluid.23.1.601", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "10.1145/1057432.1057452", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1007/s100219900068", "10.2514/2.744", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1016/0960-0779(94)90137-6", "10.1016/0010-4655(88)90020-3", "10.1109/visual.1991.175773", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1016/j.ijengsci.2007.10.005", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.11", "10.1111/cgf.13439", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1145/2897824.2925919", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0011-7471(70)90059-8", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1053"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13689", "year": "2019", "title": "Robust Reference Frame Extraction from Unsteady 2D Vector Fields with Convolutional Neural Networks", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Byungsoo Kim;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Kim, B (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nKim, Byungsoo; Guenther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Robust feature extraction is an integral part of scientific visualization.

The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets. The application of this accurate segmentation and visualization of sparse and complicated 3D microvascular structure facilitated by our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular disease.", "keywords": "Deep neural network,3D cerebrovascular segmentation and visualization,maximum intensity projection (MIP),joint embedding", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030374", "refList": ["10.1109/cluster.2018.00036", "10.1109/iccv.2015.123", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.133", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.19", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934312", "10.1007/978-3-319-46487-9\\_40", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.175", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70523", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2880207", "10.1145/3309993", "10.1109/pacificvis.2018.00018", "10.1109/iccv.2017.244", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.632", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816059", "10.1109/pacificvis.2009.4906852", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864808", "10.1109/mcg.2018.2881523", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467431", "10.1109/tpami.2015.2439281", "10.1109/pacificvis48177.2020.8737", "10.1109/cvpr.2019.00244", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.165", "10.1109/bigdata.2018.8622520", "10.1007/978-3-319-46466-4\\_29", "10.1109/visual.2019.8933759", "10.1145/3197517.3201304", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742378", "10.1109/cvpr.2006.91", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742369", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934255", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1007/978-3-319-24574-4\\_28", "10.1109/pacificvis.2019.00041", "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934332", "10.1109/cvpr.2018.00916", "10.1007/978-3-319-46475-6\\_43"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}], "len": 7}], "len": 9}, {"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13421", "year": "2018", "title": "Visualization of 4D Vector Field Topology", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Lutz Hofmann;Bastian Rieck;Filip Sadlo", "citationCount": "2", "affiliation": "Hofmann, L (Corresponding Author), Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany.\nHofmann, Lutz; Rieck, Bastian; Sadlo, Filip, Heidelberg Univ, Heidelberg, Germany.", "countries": "Germany", "abstract": "In this paper, we present an approach to the topological analysis of four-dimensional vector fields.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs. Using our method, users gain deeper insights into the dynamics of inertial particles in 2D fluids, including size-dependent separation, preferential clustering and attraction.

The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.", "keywords": "Vortex extraction,inertial particles,objectivity,vortex coreline", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828", "refList": ["10.1016/0377-0257(79)87004-4", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1016/0167-2789(91)90088-q", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70633", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_9", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1017/s002211209900467x", "10.1143/jpsj.66.1331", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1017/s0022112092001460", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01238.x", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/visual.1997.663910", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1146/annurev.fluid.23.1.601", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "10.1145/1057432.1057452", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1007/s100219900068", "10.2514/2.744", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1016/0960-0779(94)90137-6", "10.1016/0010-4655(88)90020-3", "10.1109/visual.1991.175773", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1016/j.ijengsci.2007.10.005", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.11", "10.1111/cgf.13439", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1145/2897824.2925919", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0011-7471(70)90059-8", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1053"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13689", "year": "2019", "title": "Robust Reference Frame Extraction from Unsteady 2D Vector Fields with Convolutional Neural Networks", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Byungsoo Kim;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Kim, B (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nKim, Byungsoo; Guenther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Robust feature extraction is an integral part of scientific visualization.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets.

Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs.

Their backward integration is in practice infeasible, since a slight change in the initial velocity causes extreme changes in the recovered position. Thus, if an inertial particle is observed, it is difficult to recover where it came from. This is known as the source inversion problem, which has many practical applications in recovering the source of airborne or waterborne pollutions. Inertial trajectories live in a higher dimensional spatio-velocity space. In this paper, we show that this space is only sparsely populated. Assuming that inertial particles are released with a given initial velocity (e.g., from rest), particles may reach a certain location only with a limited set of possible velocities. In fact, with increasing integration duration and dependent on the particle response time, inertial particles converge to a terminal velocity. We show that the set of initial positions that lead to the same location form a curve. We extract these curves by devising a derived vector field in which they appear as tangent curves. Most importantly, the derived vector field only involves forward integrated flow map gradients, which are much more stable to compute than backward trajectories. After extraction, we interactively visualize the curves in the domain and display the reached velocities using glyphs. In addition, we encode the rate of change of the terminal velocity along the curves, which gives a notion for the convergence to the terminal velocity. With this, we present the first solution to the source inversion problem that considers actual inertial trajectories.

Compared to massless particles, the velocity of an inertial particle is not determined solely by its position and time in a vector field.

The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs. Using our method, users gain deeper insights into the dynamics of inertial particles in 2D fluids, including size-dependent separation, preferential clustering and attraction.

Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.", "keywords": "Vortex extraction,inertial particles,objectivity,vortex coreline", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828", "refList": ["10.1016/0377-0257(79)87004-4", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1016/0167-2789(91)90088-q", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70633", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_9", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1017/s002211209900467x", "10.1143/jpsj.66.1331", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1017/s0022112092001460", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01238.x", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/visual.1997.663910", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1146/annurev.fluid.23.1.601", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "10.1145/1057432.1057452", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1007/s100219900068", "10.2514/2.744", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1016/0960-0779(94)90137-6", "10.1016/0010-4655(88)90020-3", "10.1109/visual.1991.175773", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1016/j.ijengsci.2007.10.005", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.11", "10.1111/cgf.13439", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1145/2897824.2925919", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0011-7471(70)90059-8", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1053"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13689", "year": "2019", "title": "Robust Reference Frame Extraction from Unsteady 2D Vector Fields with Convolutional Neural Networks", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Byungsoo Kim;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Kim, B (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nKim, Byungsoo; Guenther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Robust feature extraction is an integral part of scientific visualization.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons.

Their backward integration is in practice infeasible, since a slight change in the initial velocity causes extreme changes in the recovered position. Thus, if an inertial particle is observed, it is difficult to recover where it came from. This is known as the source inversion problem, which has many practical applications in recovering the source of airborne or waterborne pollutions. Inertial trajectories live in a higher dimensional spatio-velocity space. In this paper, we show that this space is only sparsely populated. Assuming that inertial particles are released with a given initial velocity (e.g., from rest), particles may reach a certain location only with a limited set of possible velocities. In fact, with increasing integration duration and dependent on the particle response time, inertial particles converge to a terminal velocity. We show that the set of initial positions that lead to the same location form a curve. We extract these curves by devising a derived vector field in which they appear as tangent curves. Most importantly, the derived vector field only involves forward integrated flow map gradients, which are much more stable to compute than backward trajectories. After extraction, we interactively visualize the curves in the domain and display the reached velocities using glyphs. In addition, we encode the rate of change of the terminal velocity along the curves, which gives a notion for the convergence to the terminal velocity. With this, we present the first solution to the source inversion problem that considers actual inertial trajectories.

In this paper, we present a novel approach to the analysis of the force-induced dynamics of inertial particles. These forces can arise from acceleration fields such as gravitation, but also be dependent on the particle dynamics itself, as in the case of magnetism. Compared to massless particles, the velocity of an inertial particle is not determined solely by its position and time in a vector field. In contrast, its initial velocity can be arbitrary and impacts the dynamics over its entire lifetime. This leads to a four-dimensional problem for 2D setups, and a six-dimensional problem for the 3D case. Our approach avoids this increase in dimensionality and tackles the visualization by an integrated topological analysis approach.

The center of the rotating motion is called the vortex coreline and its successful detection strongly depends on the choice of the reference frame. The optimal frame moves with the center of the vortex, which incidentally makes the observed fluid flow steady and thus standard vortex coreline extractors such as Sujudi-Haimes become applicable. Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs. Using our method, users gain deeper insights into the dynamics of inertial particles in 2D fluids, including size-dependent separation, preferential clustering and attraction.

Recently, an objective optimization framework was proposed that determines a near-steady reference frame for tracer particles. In this paper, we extend this technique to the detection of vortex corelines of inertial particles. An inertial particle is a finite-sized object that is carried by a fluid flow. In contrast to the usual tracer particles, they do not move tangentially with the flow, since they are subject to gravity and exhibit mass-dependent inertia. Their particle state is determined by their position and own velocity, which makes the search for the optimal frame a high-dimensional problem. We demonstrate in this paper that the objective detection of an inertial vortex coreline can be reduced in 2D to a critical point search in 2D. For 3D flows, however, the vortex coreline criterion remains a parallel vectors condition in 6D. To detect the vortex corelines we propose a recursive subdivision approach that is tailored to the underlying structure of the 6D vectors. The resulting algorithm is objective, and we demonstrate the vortex coreline extraction in a number of 2D and 3D vector fields.", "keywords": "Vortex extraction,inertial particles,objectivity,vortex coreline", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864828", "refList": ["10.1016/0377-0257(79)87004-4", "10.1111/cgf.12358", "10.1016/0167-2789(91)90088-q", "10.1109/2.35197", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70633", "10.1007/978-3-540-70823-0\\_9", "10.1016/b978-012387582-2/50040-x", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1017/s002211209900467x", "10.1143/jpsj.66.1331", "10.1063/1.857730", "10.1017/s0022112092001460", "10.1016/s0097-8493(02)00056-0", "10.1017/jfm.2016.151", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2008.01238.x", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/visual.1997.663910", "10.1109/visual.1999.809896", "10.1146/annurev.fluid.23.1.601", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467200", "10.1145/1057432.1057452", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1007/s100219900068", "10.2514/2.744", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1016/0960-0779(94)90137-6", "10.1016/0010-4655(88)90020-3", "10.1109/visual.1991.175773", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1017/s0022112004002526", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1016/j.ijengsci.2007.10.005", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.11", "10.1111/cgf.13439", "10.1016/j.crme.2015.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70545", "10.1145/2897824.2925919", "10.1109/visual.1998.745296", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0011-7471(70)90059-8", "10.1017/s0022112095000462", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.1053"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13689", "year": "2019", "title": "Robust Reference Frame Extraction from Unsteady 2D Vector Fields with Convolutional Neural Networks", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Byungsoo Kim;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Kim, B (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nKim, Byungsoo; Guenther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Robust feature extraction is an integral part of scientific visualization.

For example, extracting and visualizing microstructures in-vivo have been a long-standing challenging problem. However, due to the high sparseness and noisiness in cerebrovasculature data as well as highly complex geometry and topology variations of micro vessels, it is still extremely challenging to extract the complete 3D vessel structure and visualize it in 3D with high fidelity. In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D microvascular structure through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection (MIP), into the 3D volumetric image learning process to enhance the overall performance. The core novelty is to automatically leverage the volume visualization technique (e.g., MIP - a volume rendering scheme for 3D volume images) to enhance the 3D data exploration at the deep learning level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal (through canceling out the noise) and adapt to the geometric variability and scalability of vessels, which is of great importance in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream convolutional neural network (CNN) framework is proposed to effectively learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP feature vectors, respectively, and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting the 2D feature vectors into the 3D volume embedding space. It is noted that the proposed framework can better capture the small/micro vessels and improve the vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a deep learning framework is proposed to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically. Experimental results are evaluated and compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the state-of-the-art in deep learning, by using extensive public and real patient (micro- )cerebrovascular image datasets.

These finite-sized objects are called inertial particles and, in contrast to traditional tracer particles, their motion depends on their current position, their own particle velocity, the time and their size. Thus, the visualization of their motion becomes a high-dimensional problem that entails computational and perceptual challenges. So far, no visualization explored and visualized the particle trajectories under variation of all seeding parameters. In this paper, we propose three coordinated views that visualize the different aspects of the high-dimensional space in which the particles live. We visualize the evolution of particles over time, showing that particles travel different distances in the same time, depending on their size. The second view provides a clear illustration of the trajectories of different particle sizes and allows the user to easily identify differences due to particle size. Finally, we embed the trajectories in the space-velocity domain and visualize their distance to an attracting manifold using ribbons. In all views, we support interactive linking and brushing, and provide abstraction through density volumes that are shown by direct volume rendering and isosurface slabs. Using our method, users gain deeper insights into the dynamics of inertial particles in 2D fluids, including size-dependent separation, preferential clustering and attraction. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in multiple steady and unsteady 2D flows.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13420", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2013.143", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467204", "10.1145/1618452.1618487", "10.1109/visual.1998.745323", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.5194/npg-22-571-2015", "10.1109/visual.1996.567777", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1103/physreve.93.033108", "10.1007/s11538-010-9594-4", "10.1109/visual.1997.663867", "10.1109/icdmw.2009.55", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346319", "10.1016/j.physd.2005.10.007", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346455", "10.1016/s0167-2789(00)00142-1", "10.1175/2009jas2865.1", "10.1016/j.nonrwa.2014.08.002", "10.1109/mcg.2014.52", "10.1117/12.906872", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346415", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1109/2945.981847", "10.1023/a:1001816013475", "10.1007/s10569-015-9617-4", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2010.01650.x", "10.1063/1.864230", "10.1017/s0022112008005089", "10.1088/1742-6596/333/1/012003", "10.1111/cgf.12108", "10.1007/978-94-007-2482-2\\_30", "10.1111/cgf.12913", "10.1111/cgf.13115", "10.1109/vast.2015.7347634", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1103/physreve.84.016406", "10.1016/j.physd.2007.09.027", "10.1088/0031-8949/2010/t142/014001", "10.1016/0022-0396(79)90152-9"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13978", "year": "2020", "title": "Phase Space Projection of Dynamical Systems", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Nemanja Bartolovic;Markus Gross;Tobias G{\\\"{u}}nther", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Bartolovic, N (Corresponding Author), Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.\nBartolovic, Nemanja; Gross, Markus; Gunther, Tobias, Swiss Fed Inst Technol, Dept Comp Sci, Zurich, Switzerland.", "countries": "Switzerland", "abstract": "Dynamical systems are commonly used to describe the state of time-dependent systems. In many engineering and control problems, the state space is high-dimensional making it difficult to analyze and visualize the behavior of the system for varying input conditions. We present a novel dimensionality reduction technique that is tailored to high-dimensional dynamical systems. In contrast to standard general purpose dimensionality reduction algorithms, we use energy minimization to preserve properties of the flow in the high-dimensional space. Once the projection operator is optimized, further high-dimensional trajectories are projected easily. Our 3D projection maintains a number of useful flow properties, such as critical points and flow maps, and is optimized to match geometric characteristics of the high-dimensional input, as well as optional user constraints. We apply our method to trajectories traced in the phase spaces of second-order dynamical systems, including finite-sized objects in fluids, the circular restricted three-body problem and a damped double pendulum. We compare the projections with standard visualization techniques, such as PCA, t-SNE and UMAP, and visualize the dynamical systems with multiple coordinated views interactively, featuring a spatial embedding, projection to subspaces, our dimensionality reduction and a seed point exploration tool.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13978", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2013.182", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.153", "10.1007/s003710050110", "10.1063/1.2204064", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01958.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599016", "10.1109/visual.1996.567777", "10.1109/infvis.2004.68", "10.1038/nbt.4314", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.254", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.27", "10.1111/cgf.12846", "10.1162/089976698300017467", "10.1111/cgf.13421", "10.1007/978-3-540-33037-08", "10.1038/s41591-019-0521-4", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.65", "10.1111/cgf.13828", "10.1080/13506280444000102.http://www.uvt.nl/ticc", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.78", "10.1037/h0071325", "10.1111/cgf.13114", "10.1111/cgf.13420", "10.1111/cgf.12659", "10.1145/3072959.3073684", "10.1109/cahpc.2018.8645912", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.177", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.201", "10.1016/j.arcontrol.2005.08.002", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2640960", "10.1007/s11071-005-2790-3", "10.1109/sbac-pad.2018.00060", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467132.3", "10.1007/978-3-540", "10.1088/0034-4885/77/6/065901", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599018", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2846735", "10.1007/bf02199365", "10.1007/978-3-540-33037-0\\_8"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}], "len": 41}], "len": 251}, "index": 349, "embedding": [-2.1186776161193848, 1.1483012437820435, -1.059349536895752, -2.3949873447418213, 6.469146251678467, 0.16650904715061188, 14.732076644897461, 16.803741455078125, 48.06899642944336, 4.622032642364502, 17.013317108154297, 4.781463623046875, 10.858161926269531, 16.48302459716797, 7.58343505859375, -0.5486658811569214, 7.564975738525391, 0.07991757988929749, 4.9925947189331055, 4.448153018951416, -0.06630208343267441, 7.223520755767822, 10.067964553833008, 10.666912078857422, -2.0616583824157715, 26.606834411621094, -0.5399249196052551, -0.17674389481544495, 0.4586997926235199, -2.582859516143799, 11.562337875366211, 1.9148021936416626], "projection": [2.7047479152679443, 12.174367904663086], "size": 126, "height": 8, "width": 35}
