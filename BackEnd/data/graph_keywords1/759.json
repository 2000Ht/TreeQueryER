Clinical work flows and research based on pathology have, until now, largely been dominated by 2D imaging. As we will show in the paper, studying volumetric histology data will open up novel and useful opportunities for both research and clinical practice. Our starting point is the current lack of appropriate visualization tools in histopathology, which has been a limiting factor in the uptake of digital pathology. Visualization of 3D histology data does pose difficult challenges in several aspects. The full-color datasets are dense and large in scale, on the order of 100,000 \u00d7 100,000 \u00d7 100 voxels. This entails serious demands on both rendering performance and user experience design. Despite this, our developed application supports interactive study of 3D histology datasets at native resolution. Our application is based on tailoring and tuning of existing methods, system integration work, as well as a careful study of domain specific demands emanating from a close participatory design process with domain experts as team members. Results from a user evaluation employing the tool demonstrate a strong agreement among the 14 participating pathologists that 3D histopathology will be a valuable and enabling tool for their work.", "keywords": "Histology,Pathology,Volume Rendering,Expert Evaluation", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2018.2864816", "refList": ["10.4103/2153-3539.129452", "10.2312/vissym/vissym02/115-124", "10.1371/journal.pone.0126817", "10.1093/ajcp/138.suppl1.288", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.150", "10.4103/2153-3539.151890", "10.1109/mcg.2010.26", "10.1109/tbme.2014.2303294", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.240", "10.1111/cgf.12605", "10.1007/s00371-008-0261-9", "10.1109/tvcg.2002.1021579", "10.1016/j.mri.2012.05.001", "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031591", "10.1111/his.12629", "10.2312/vissym/vissym00/137-146", "10.4103/2153-3539.151894", "10.1186/s12859-017-1934-z", "10.1117/12.813756", "10.1145/2834117", "10.1111/his.13452", "10.1111/cgf.12934", "10.1001/jama.2017.14585", "10.1016/j.ajpath.2012.01.033", "10.1109/visual.2002.1183757", "10.4103/2153-3539.114206", "10.17629/www.diagnosticpathology.eu-2016-2:232", "10.1109/mcg.2013.55", "10.1073/pnas.1710742114", "10.1117/12.529137", "10.2312/vg/vg-pbg08/163-170", "10.4103/2153-3539.119005"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 759, "embedding": [-0.8331408500671387, -0.2658282518386841, -1.0222129821777344, -1.357039451599121, -0.630656361579895, 0.16650904715061188, 4.087556838989258, 1.6074880361557007, -0.4060705304145813, 0.3571750223636627, -0.49700692296028137, -0.6026856303215027, -0.1321265697479248, 0.03847339376807213, 0.7131177186965942, 0.43597081303596497, -0.20636838674545288, 0.07000205665826797, -0.6329802870750427, -0.4570968449115753, -0.06630208343267441, 0.24232381582260132, -0.7513450384140015, -0.1290702521800995, -0.8015584945678711, 0.09817054867744446, -0.008241101168096066, -0.1698274314403534, 0.14418578147888184, 2.5661473274230957, -0.8841081857681274, -0.05274522677063942], "projection": [-3.8379268646240234, -4.464970588684082], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
