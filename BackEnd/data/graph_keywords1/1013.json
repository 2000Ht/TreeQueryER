Experts are interested in analyzing players' passing behavior to learn passing tactics, i.e., how players build up an attack with passing. Various approaches have been proposed to facilitate the analysis of passing tactics. However, the dynamic changes of a team's employed tactics over a match have not been comprehensively investigated. To address the problem, we closely collaborate with domain experts and characterize requirements to analyze the dynamic changes of a team's passing tactics. To characterize the passing tactic employed for each attack, we propose a topic-based approach that provides a high-level abstraction of complex passing behaviors. Based on the model, we propose a glyph-based design to reveal the multi-variate information of passing tactics within different phases of attacks, including player identity, spatial context, and formation. We further design and develop PassVizor, a visual analytics system, to support the comprehensive analysis of passing dynamics. With the system, users can detect the changing patterns of passing tactics and examine the detailed passing process for evaluating passing tactics. We invite experts to conduct analysis with PassVizor and demonstrate the usability of the system through an expert interview.", "keywords": "Soccer Analysis,Passing Analysis", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2020.3030359", "refList": ["10.1007/s10827-013-0458-4", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598838", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744938", "10.1109/tpami.2016.2644615", "10.1107/s1600576719008665", "10.18653/v1/d17-1042", "10.1557/mrc", "10.1109/cvpr.2017.690", "10.1145/57167.57203", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2816223", "10.1107/s205225251700714x", "10.1016/0377-0427(87)90125-7", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744878", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744718", "10.1109/wacv.2017.83", "10.1109/tnnls.2018.2876865", "10.1109/tpami.1979.4766909", "10.1109/mcg.2018.042731661", "10.2312/eurovisshort.20161164", "10.18653/v1/n16", "10.1107/s160057671302832x", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864500", "10.1109/iccv.2017.74", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.90", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744358", "10.1109/wacv.2014.6836004", "10.18653/v1/n16-3020", "10.1109/cvpr.2016.319", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1013, "embedding": [-2.1687960624694824, -0.12318453937768936, -1.0662840604782104, -2.350348949432373, -0.6415178775787354, 0.16650904715061188, 2.3435349464416504, 0.12407219409942627, 0.26912978291511536, -0.27373701333999634, -1.6827874183654785, -0.9575150012969971, -0.06576478481292725, -1.790603756904602, 2.1297459602355957, -0.3219202756881714, -0.1492859125137329, 0.06589167565107346, -0.32634687423706055, -0.9167535305023193, -0.06630208343267441, -0.6124352812767029, -0.6181665062904358, -0.15392345190048218, -1.8551592826843262, 1.2173576354980469, 1.6047528982162476, -0.1945725977420807, -0.5880303382873535, 1.3646689653396606, -1.1636772155761719, -0.2697070837020874], "projection": [-4.547798156738281, -4.530014991760254], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
