However, the choice of a specific data structure for a given data set depends on several factors, such as the memory budget, the sparsity of the data, and data access patterns. In general, there is no single optimal sparse data structure, but a set of several candidates with individual strengths and drawbacks. One solution to this problem are hybrid data structures which locally adapt themselves to the sparsity. However, they typically suffer from increased traversal overhead which limits their utility in many applications. This paper presents JiTTree, a novel sparse hybrid volume data structure that uses just-in-time compilation to overcome these problems. By combining multiple sparse data structures and reducing traversal overhead we leverage their individual advantages. We demonstrate that hybrid data structures adapt well to a large range of data sets. They are especially superior to other sparse data structures for data sets that locally vary in sparsity. Possible optimization criteria are memory, performance and a combination thereof. Through just-in-time (JIT) compilation, JiTTree reduces the traversal overhead of the resulting optimal data structure. As a result, our hybrid volume data structure enables efficient computations on the GPU, while being superior in terms of memory usage when compared to non-hybrid data structures.", "keywords": "Data Transformation and Representation, GPUs and Multi-core Architectures, Volume Rendering", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2015.2467331", "refList": ["10.1145/1071866.1071869", "10.1145/2480359.2429128", "10.1145/2184319.2184345", "10.1145/1507149.1507152", "10.1016/j.cag.2004.06.010", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01377.x", "10.1007/bf00288933", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.240", "10.1145/1122501.1122505", "10.1145/1141911.1141926", "10.1145/2584665", "10.1145/358728.358741", "10.1145/361002.361007", "10.1109/hpca.2011.5749745", "10.1109/icip.1999.822944", "10.1145/280277.280279"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599043", "title": "A Versatile and Efficient GPU Data Structure for Spatial Indexing", "year": "2016", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Jens Schneider;Peter Rautek", "citationCount": "4", "affiliation": "Schneider, J (Corresponding Author), King Abdullah Univ Sci \\& Technol KAUST, Visual Comp Ctr, Thuwal, Saudi Arabia.

These data often contain many fine and intricate structures, which pose huge challenges for volume rendering, and make it particularly important to efficiently skip empty space. This paper addresses two major challenges: (1) The complexity of large volumes containing fine structures often leads to highly fragmented space subdivisions that make empty regions hard to skip efficiently. (2) The classification of space into empty and non-empty regions changes frequently, because the user or the evaluation of an interactive query activate a different set of objects, which makes it unfeasible to pre-compute a well-adapted space subdivision. We describe the novel SparseLeap method for efficient empty space skipping in very large volumes, even around fine structures. The main performance characteristic of SparseLeap is that it moves the major cost of empty space skipping out of the ray-casting stage. We achieve this via a hybrid strategy that balances the computational load between determining empty ray segments in a rasterization (object-order) stage, and sampling non-empty volume data in the ray-casting (image-order) stage. Before ray-casting, we exploit the fast hardware rasterization of GPUs to create a ray segment list for each pixel, which identifies non-empty regions along the ray. The ray-casting stage then leaps over empty space without hierarchy traversal. Ray segment lists are created by rasterizing a set of fine-grained, view-independent bounding boxes. Frame coherence is exploited by re-using the same bounding boxes unless the set of active objects changes. We show that SparseLeap scales better to large, sparse data than standard octree empty space skipping.", "keywords": "Empty Space Skipping,Volume Rendering,Segmented Volume Data,Hybrid Image/Object-Order Approaches", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2017.2744238", "refList": ["10.1109/ldav.2013.6675157", "10.1145/353888.353889", "10.1145/1073204.1073277", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2010.01725.x", "10.1364/boe.2.002888", "10.1007/pl00013406", "10.1007/s00371-010-0453-y", "10.1109/visual.2002.1183775", "10.1145/1071866.1071869", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2005.00855.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.161", "10.1109/visual.1999.809908", "10.1109/visual.1995.480792", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.240", "10.1109/visual.1992.235231", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467331", "10.1109/visual.1990.146377", "10.1111/cgf.12605", "10.1007/s00371-008-0261-9", "10.1109/tvcg.2003.1207442", "10.1109/visual.2004.63", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2007.01064.x", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.142", "10.1145/1730804.1730814", "10.1109/visual.2003.1250388", "10.1145/1507149.1507152", "10.1145/1618452.1618498", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.70532", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.197", "10.1109/visual.2003.1250384", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.274", "10.1109/pacificvis.2011.5742355", "10.1109/bigdata.2013.6691717", "10.1109/visual.2001.964521", "10.1109/visual.1999.809911", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2009.01466.x"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864847", "title": "Culling for Extreme-Scale Segmentation Volumes: A Hybrid Deterministic and Probabilistic Approach", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "SciVis", "authors": "Johanna Beyer;Haneen Mohammed;Marco Agus;Ali K.

Often, it is crucial to be able to rapidly identify which segments are located where, whether for empty space skipping for fast rendering, or for spatial proximity queries. We refer to this process as<i>culling</i>. In order to enable efficient culling of millions of labeled segments, we present a novel hybrid approach that combines deterministic and probabilistic representations of label data in a data-adaptive hierarchical data structure that we call the label list tree. In each node, we adaptively encode label data using either a probabilistic constant-time access representation for fast conservative culling, or a deterministic logarithmic-time access representation for exact queries. We choose the best data structures for representing the labels of each spatial region while building the label list tree. At run time, we further employ a novel<i>query-adaptive</i>culling strategy. While filtering a query down the tree, we prune it successively, and in each node adaptively select the representation that is best suited for evaluating the pruned query, depending on its size. We show an analysis of the efficiency of our approach with several large data sets from connectomics, including a brain scan with more than 13 million labeled segments, and compare our method to conventional culling approaches.

However, the global nature of many topological structures makes their computation challenging at scale, and thus often limits the size of data that can be processed. One key quality to achieving scalability and performance on modern architectures is data locality, i.e., a process operates on data that resides in a nearby memory system, avoiding frequent jumps in data access patterns. From this perspective, topological computations are particularly challenging because the implied data structures represent features that can span the entire data set, often requiring a global traversal phase that limits their scalability. Traditionally, expensive preprocessing is considered an acceptable trade-off as it accelerates all subsequent queries. Most published use cases, however, explore only a fraction of all possible queries, most often those returning small, local features. In these cases, much of the global information is not utilized, yet computing it dominates the overall response time. We address this challenge for merge trees, one of the most commonly used topological structures. In particular, we propose an alternative representation, the merge forest, a collection of local trees corresponding to regions in a domain decomposition. Local trees are connected by a bridge set that allows us to recover any necessary global information at query time. The resulting system couples (i) a preprocessing that scales linearly in practice with (ii) fast runtime queries that provide the same functionality as traditional queries of a global merge tree. We test the scalability of our approach on a shared-memory parallel computer and demonstrate how data structure locality enables the analysis of large data with an order of magnitude performance improvement over the status quo. Furthermore, a merge forest reduces the memory overhead compared to a global merge tree and enables the processing of data sets that are an order of magnitude larger than possible with previous algorithms.", "keywords": "Merge tree,parallel computation,topology", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934257", "refList": ["10.1109/ldav.2017.8231846", "10.1145/276884.276892", "10.1090/mbk/069", "10.1007/s00454-002-2885-2", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2452919", "10.1016/0956-0521(91)90014-v", "10.1145/262839.269238", "10.1145/364099.364331", "10.1016/j.comgeo.2006.05.009", "10.1109/ldav.2016.7874333", "10.1080/16864360.2017.1419648", "10.1016/s0925-7721(02)00093-7", "10.1145/2517327.2442526", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2743938", "10.1016/j.proci.2014.05.147", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.253", "10.1103/physrevlett.113.155005", "10.1007/978-3-319-44684-420", "10.1109/ldav.2016.7874312", "10.1007/b106657\\_2", "10.1109/sc.2014.88", "10.1109/ldav.2015.7348066", "10.1007/978-3-319-04099-86", "10.1109/ldav.2012.6378962", "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031584", "10.2140/camcos.2016.11.37", "10.1016/j.combustflame.2014.08.021", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.22", "10.1007/pl00009159", "10.1007/s00453-003-1052-3", "10.1109/tvcg.2007.47", "10.1017/jfm.2015.268", "10.1007/s00454-017-9901-z", "10.1145/62.2160", "10.1145/2996913.2996952", "10.1145/1868237.1868249", "10.1145/77635.77639", "10.1016/j.comgeo.2004.05.002", "10.1088/1742-6596/180/1/012086", "10.1109/pacificvis.2015.7156387", "10.1109/tpds.2019.2898436", "10.1145/1463822.1463869", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744238", "10.1109/hipc.2012.6507496", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.162", "10.1017/s0022112004009681", "10.2307/2317380"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}, {"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13700", "year": "2019", "title": "Interactive Volumetric Visual Analysis of Glycogen-derived Energy Absorption in Nanometric Brain Structures", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Marco Agus;Corrado Cal{\\`{\\i}};Ali K.

Emerging applications range from statistical analysis on image stacks to complex connectomics visual analysis tools targeted to develop and test hypotheses of brain development and activity. In this work, we focus on neuroenergetics, a field where neuroscientists analyze nanoscale brain morphology and relate energy consumption to glucose storage in form of glycogen granules. In order to facilitate the understanding of neuroenergetic mechanisms, we propose a novel customized pipeline for the visual analysis of nanometric-level reconstructions based on electron microscopy image data. Our framework supports analysis tasks by combining i) a scalable volume visualization architecture able to selectively render image stacks and corresponding labelled data, ii) a method for highlighting distance-based energy absorption probabilities in form of glow maps, and iii) a hybrid connectivitybased and absorption-based interactive layout representation able to support queries for selective analysis of areas of interest and potential activity within the segmented datasets. This working pipeline is currently used in a variety of studies in the neuroenergetics domain. Here, we discuss a test case in which the framework was successfully used by domain scientists for the analysis of aging effects on glycogen metabolism, extracting knowledge from a series of nanoscale brain stacks of rodents somatosensory cortex.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13700", "refList": ["10.1371/journal.pone.0038011", "10.1016/j.coisb.2017.07.011", "10.1145/234535.234538", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864847", "10.2312/conf/eg2012/stars/053-074", "10.3389/fnins.2018.00664", "10.1109/tpami.2018.2835450", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346312", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.121", "10.1002/glia.23020", "10.1117/1.jbo.18.5.050902", "10.1111/cgf.12927", "10.1038/nn.3837", "10.1109/isbi.2011.5872394", "10.3868/j.issn.2096-0689.2017.04.004", "10.1111/cgf.12792", "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2012.09.077", "10.1109/tvcg.2012.240", "10.1523/jneurosci.4825-12.2013", "10.1002/cne.23852", "10.2312/vcbm.20151213", "10.1111/cgf.12605", "10.1016/j.cag.2018.04.007", "10.1038/s41592-018-0049-4", "10.1007/s00371-015-1151-6", "10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864852", "10.1109/ic3d.2016.7823463", "10.3389/fncel.2019.00082", "10.1111/boc.201600024", "10.2312/vg/vg10/053-060", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.142", "10.1371/journal.pone.0198131", "10.1111/cgf.12280", "10.1038/nature22356", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467441", "10.1016/j.neuron.2015.03.035", "10.2312/vcbm.20161276", "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.07.014", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744238", "10.1002/glia.23250", "10.3389/fncel.2018.00308", "10.1016/j.cell.2018.06.019", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744278", "10.1109/biovis.2013.6664349", "10.1179/000870403235002042"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 9}], "len": 15}, "index": 456, "embedding": [0.08494289964437485, 0.9032419919967651, -1.0222129821777344, -1.4795129299163818, -0.630656361579895, 0.16650904715061188, -0.7150075435638428, 1.438258409500122, -0.4060705304145813, 0.6099424958229065, 0.05161124840378761, 0.26934120059013367, 0.10407781600952148, 0.23458082973957062, -0.660598874092102, 1.2228456735610962, 0.39926499128341675, 1.777032494544983, -0.6329802870750427, 1.1589953899383545, -0.06630208343267441, 1.0979650020599365, -0.7330083847045898, 1.2215912342071533, -2.458800792694092, 0.6377875208854675, -0.5019459128379822, 0.6366093158721924, 1.5788642168045044, -1.1703230142593384, -0.14383606612682343, 0.6078281998634338], "projection": [-0.3730791509151459, 8.035012245178223], "size": 8, "height": 4, "width": 4}
