To comprehensively learn about the dynamic environments, it is necessary to comprehend features from multiple data sources. This paper proposes a novel visual analysis approach for detecting and analyzing concept drifts from multi-sourced time-series. We propose a visual detection scheme for discovering concept drifts from multiple sourced time-series based on prediction models. We design a drift level index to depict the dynamics, and a consistency judgment model to justify whether the concept drifts from various sources are consistent. Our integrated visual interface, ConceptExplorer, facilitates visual exploration, extraction, understanding, and comparison of concepts and concept drifts from multi-source time-series data. We conduct three case studies and expert interviews to verify the effectiveness of our approach.", "keywords": "Temporal data; data analysis,reasoning,problem solving,and decision making; machine learning techniques,Temporal data,data analysis, reasoning, problem solving, and decision making,machine learning techniques", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00006", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467851,10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598468,10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467553,10.1109/tvcg.2016.2599378,10.1109/tvcg.2009.200,10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865018,10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744938,10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745298,10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467751,10.1109/tvcg.2017.2745139,10.1109/vast50239.2020.00007"], "wos": 0, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1218, "embedding": [0.054338499903678894, -0.11443188786506653, -0.6208970546722412, -2.2706918716430664, -0.43267613649368286, 0.16650904715061188, -0.6826844215393066, -0.8996906876564026, 0.5127161145210266, -0.8447319865226746, 1.0964618921279907, -0.9690837264060974, -0.12592144310474396, -0.5435797572135925, 0.6856870651245117, -0.5551779270172119, 0.23282122611999512, 0.06402745097875595, 0.6590924263000488, -0.4995460510253906, -0.06630208343267441, -0.6541746258735657, -0.2207961082458496, -0.13563132286071777, -2.565751552581787, 0.09350619465112686, -0.13378676772117615, 0.4019555151462555, -0.5601260662078857, 0.8534917831420898, 0.2550927698612213, -0.1307383030653], "projection": [2.159613609313965, 2.5136349201202393], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
