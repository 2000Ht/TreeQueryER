Among all the existing studies related to MOOCs, most of them focus on individuals' study behaviors and evaluations (e.g., analysis on click streams for video-watching behavior exploration, etc.) for course design purposes. However, in addition to traditional course materials, MOOCs also provide interactive user forums to encourage students to seek help from peers, which endows the courses with social network formation and interaction. Thus, we present NetworkSeer to help evaluate why MOOC students use forums, and what they do. NetworkSeer visualizes interactions in the forum, including where, when the interactions happen, and why. It also enables filtering out un-targeted groups. A case study is conducted to demonstrate its usefulness.", "keywords": "K.3.1. {[}Computers and Education]: Computer Uses in Education-Distance Learning", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2016.7465269", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2012.252", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.160", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042494", "10.1111/j.1467-8535.2005.00542.x", "10.1073/pnas.0307545100", "10.1145/2556325.2566249", "10.1016/j.ijhcs.2006.08.008", "10.1145/985692.985762", "10.1109/icalt.2008.276", "10.1016/j.compedu.2011.08.026", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.01955.x", "10.1111/cgf.12093", "10.1109/vast.2014.7042528"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/vast.2018.8802383", "title": "VUSphere: Visual Analysis of Video Utilization in Online Distance Education", "year": "2018", "conferenceName": "VAST", "authors": "Huan He;Qinghua Zheng;Bo Dong", "citationCount": "1", "affiliation": "He, H (Corresponding Author), Xi An Jiao Tong Univ, Minist Educ, Key Lab Intelligent Networks \\& Network Secur, Xian, Shaanxi, Peoples R China.

Analyzing the utilization of these videos from user log data can help academics better understand the learning process of students, evaluate the quality of service provided by regional learning centers, and improve the quality of program curriculum in the future. However, due to the lack of comparable indicators, it is a great challenge to discover the utilization patterns of massive videos and analyze the learning process of large-scale student population from learning log data. In this paper, we introduce a visual analytics system, called VUSphere, to explore the video utilization from multiple perspectives with two proposed indicators. This system offers three coordinated views: a spherical layout overview to depict the overall utilization distribution of videos, courses, and students; a detailed statistics view with four panels to present video utilization statistics of each element from multiple perspectives; and a comparison view to examine the differences in individual elements. Based on the real dataset from our ODE school, several patterns related to video utilization and enrollment are found in the case study with our domain experts.", "keywords": "Video utilization pattern,online distance education,visual analytics", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST.2018.8802383", "refList": ["10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.11.003", "10.1109/tale.2016.7851779", "10.1109/infocom.2015.7218617", "10.1109/phosst.2017.8012696", "10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.05.003", "10.1016/j.iheduc.2017.01.001", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2505305", "10.1109/pacificvis.2015.7156373", "10.1016/j.econedurev.2016.03.010", "10.1016/j.compedu.2016.02.006", "10.1145/2876034.2876041", "10.1016/j.compedu.2017.07.007", "10.1109/tvcg.2015.2467322", "10.1016/j.eswa.2013.08.042", "10.1109/mcg.2015.137", "10.1109/pacificvis.2016.7465269", "10.1109/vast.2016.7883517", "10.1109/tlt.2012.1", "10.1145/2876034.2876051", "10.1111/j.1467-8535.2010.01093.x", "10.1145/2556325.2566237", "10.1109/vlhcc.2014.6883020", "10.1145/2724660.2724683", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598444", "10.1016/j.compedu.2015.07.002", "10.1016/j.compedu.2014.08.015", "10.1109/bigdata.2017.8258337"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 136, "embedding": [0.32350626587867737, -0.2614552974700928, 1.7035623788833618, 1.1247498989105225, -0.6195418834686279, 0.16650904715061188, -0.7477038502693176, -0.7882182002067566, -0.41535258293151855, -0.7806206345558167, -0.04410139471292496, -0.3740810751914978, -0.1268409788608551, -0.35746780037879944, 1.195089340209961, -0.4488721191883087, 0.2860867381095886, 0.06584581732749939, 0.2060324102640152, 0.9027336239814758, -0.06630208343267441, -0.4386264383792877, -0.036697693169116974, -0.12045589834451675, 0.24612736701965332, 0.10673608630895615, -0.4969606399536133, -0.16244997084140778, -0.5392300486564636, 1.73042631149292, 0.552189826965332, 0.18515658378601074], "projection": [-3.4271719455718994, 5.0171003341674805], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
