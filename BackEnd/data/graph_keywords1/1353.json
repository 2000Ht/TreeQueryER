A time slice through the visualization represents a certain point in time and can be viewed as a regular parallel-coordinates display. A vertical slice through one of the axes of the parallel-coordinates display would show a time-series plot. For a focus-and-context Integration of both views, we embed time-series plots between two adjacent axes of the parallel-coordinates plot. Both time-series plots are drawn using a pseudo three-dimensional perspective with a single vanishing point. An independent parallel-coordinates panel that connects the two perspectively displayed time-series plots can move forward and backward in time to reveal changes in the relationship between the time-dependent attributes. The visualization of time-series plots in the context of the parallel-coordinates plot facilitates the exploration of time-related aspects of the data without the need to switch to a separate display. We provide a consistent set of tools for selecting and contrasting subsets of the data, which are important for various application domains.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.12908", "refList": ["10.1109/iv.2004.1320222", "10.1145/2470654.2466443", "10.1007/978-0-85729-079-3\\_1", "10.1111/cgf.12352", "10.2312/conf/eg2013/stars/095-116", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.131", "10.1109/tvcg.2006.170", "10.1109/infvis.2004.68", "10.1145/967900.968153", "10.1109/visual.1990.146402", "10.2312/vissym/eurovis07/035-042", "10.1109/itsc.2001.948834", "10.1002/wics.145", "10.1109/vast.2009.5333911", "10.1145/2254556.2254638"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/pacificvis.2017.8031606", "year": "2017", "title": "Compression and shifting to reduce occlusion in multiple short time series", "conferenceName": "PacificVis", "authors": "Maxime Dumas;Michael J.

We present techniques for horizontally displacing the endpoints of line segments in discrete time series data that (1) enable the depiction of subsets of data and (2) reduce occlusion of endpoints. Because endpoints are not displaced vertically, their y values can still be read and compared. Unlike small multiples, our techniques do not move points with the same x or y values far from each other, making some comparison tasks easier. We present three novel techniques: compressed-superposed, compressed-juxtaposed, and shifted layers. One limitation of our techniques is that they work best when there is only a small number of x values being visualized, and additionally, one of them (compressed-superposed) modifies the slopes of curves in a way that makes the slopes incomparable. Our experimental comparison with three status quo techniques (conventional overlaid, vertically-stacked small multiples, and horizontally-stacked small multiples) shows that our proposed techniques are competitive with status quo techniques and in some cases superior.", "keywords": "I.3.6 {[}Computer Graphics]: Methodology and Techniques-Interaction techniques", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1109/PACIFICVIS.2017.8031606", "refList": ["10.1111/cgf.12908", "10.2312/conf/eg2013/stars/095-116", "10.1145/1456650.1456652", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.162", "10.1057/palgrave/ivs/9500005", "10.1111/cgf.12931", "10.1016/j.cag.2007.01.030", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500061"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1353, "embedding": [0.42180243134498596, 0.12375092506408691, 0.6312111020088196, 0.06239666789770126, -0.6870212554931641, 0.16650904715061188, 0.32020121812820435, 1.3102490901947021, -0.40999409556388855, -0.8447319865226746, 0.0714949294924736, -0.6249046921730042, -0.12592144310474396, 0.2528458833694458, 0.3302572965621948, 0.646731972694397, -0.10101368278265, 0.06402745097875595, -0.6852008700370789, 0.3914916515350342, -0.06630208343267441, 1.1950550079345703, -0.49327945709228516, -0.13563132286071777, -1.3430174589157104, 0.09350619465112686, -0.5670700073242188, -0.05700118839740753, 0.1897561103105545, 1.1276763677597046, -0.24981658160686493, 0.32943397760391235], "projection": [-4.707334995269775, 5.635169982910156], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
