In order to visually explore and compare these time series at different scales, analysts need to execute online analytical processing (OLAP) queries that include constraints and group-by's at multiple temporal hierarchies. Effective visual analysis requires these queries to be interactive. However, while existing OLAP cube-based structures can support interactive query rates, the exponential memory requirement to materialize the data cube is often unsuitable for large data sets. Moreover, none of the recent space-efficient cube data structures allow for updates. Thus, the cube must be re-computed whenever there is new data, making them impractical in a streaming scenario. We propose Time Lattice, a memory-efficient data structure that makes use of the implicit temporal hierarchy to enable interactive OLAP queries over large time series. Time Lattice is a subset of a fully materialized cube and is designed to handle fast updates and streaming data. We perform an experimental evaluation which shows that the space efficiency of the data structure does not hamper its performance when compared to the state of the art. In collaboration with signal processing and acoustics research scientists, we use the Time Lattice data structure to design the Noise Profiler, a web-based visualization framework that supports the analysis of noise from cities. We demonstrate the utility of Noise Profiler through a set of case studies.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13398", "refList": ["10.1007/978-3-642-23091-2\\_12", "10.1109/wise.2000.882407", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346452", "10.1109/tkde.2017.2740932", "10.1023/a:1009726021843", "10.1109/icdm.2008.135", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598694", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2671341", "10.1109/tvcg.2011.195", "10.1007/978-90-481-3352-9\\_4", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598624", "10.1109/icdm.2008.30", "10.1016/j.apacoust.2016.06.010", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.179", "10.1057/palgrave.ivs.9500061", "10.1109/rtss.2013.36", "10.1007/978-3-642-28534-9\\_16", "10.14778/2732951.2732953", "10.1109/wsc.2003.1261490", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.162", "10.1007/s10619-005-3296-1", "10.2312/vissym/eurovis07/027-034", "10.1016/j.cag.2007.01.030"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934434", "title": "SmartCube: An Adaptive Data Management Architecture for the Real-Time Visualization of Spatiotemporal Datasets", "year": "2019", "conferenceName": "InfoVis", "authors": "Can Liu 0004;Cong Wu 0004;Hanning Shao;Xiaoru Yuan", "citationCount": "3", "affiliation": "Yuan, XR (Corresponding Author), Peking Univ, Sch EECS, Minist Educ, Key Lab Machine Percept, Beijing, Peoples R China.

We propose a novel architecture for spatiotemporal data management. The architecture can dynamically update itself based on user queries. Datasets is stored in a tree-like structure to support memory sharing among cuboids in a logical structure of data cubes. An update mechanism is designed to create or remove cuboids on it, according to the analysis of the user queries, with the consideration of memory size limitation. Data structure is dynamically optimized according to different user queries. During a query process, user queries are recorded to predict the performance increment of the new cuboid. The creation or deletion of a cuboid is determined by performance increment. Experiment results show that our prototype system deliveries good performance towards user queries on different spatiotemporal datasets, which costing small memory size with comparable performance compared with other state-of-the-art algorithms.", "keywords": "data management,spatial-temporal data", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934434", "refList": ["10.1109/bigdata.2013.6691710", "10.1145/2882903.2882919", "10.1145/2207676.2208294", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346418", "10.1111/cgf.12129", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346452", "10.1109/icde.2002.994705", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744059", "10.1023/a:1009726021843", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598694", "10.1145/2465351.2465355", "10.1109/tvcg.2017.2671341", "10.1109/bigdata.2013.6691708", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598624", "10.1145/564691.564745", "10.1145/361002.361007", "10.1111/cgf.13414", "10.1109/tvcg.2003.1196005", "10.1109/icde.2016.7498315", "10.1145/2020408.2020579", "10.1109/tvcg.2013.179", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.191", "10.1111/cgf.13398", "10.1109/mmcs.1996.535011", "10.1109/2945.981851", "10.1109/pacificvis.2016.7465254", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346574", "10.1145/956060.956064"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1434, "embedding": [0.15436135232448578, -0.24827826023101807, -0.5757855176925659, 1.6004841327667236, 0.45359084010124207, 0.16650904715061188, 0.36578208208084106, -1.0056489706039429, -0.0014300523325800896, -0.07435406744480133, 0.2992912232875824, -0.3273097574710846, -0.13027368485927582, 0.4435349702835083, -0.6561029553413391, -0.2752699553966522, -0.1716480255126953, 0.07420150190591812, 0.11025387048721313, 1.2047805786132812, -0.06630208343267441, -0.6589808464050293, 0.4314858019351959, -0.13057257235050201, 0.5900470614433289, 0.09751410037279129, -0.5483691096305847, -0.1611158847808838, 0.07249391078948975, -0.2164730280637741, -0.23638789355754852, -0.22451727092266083], "projection": [-2.8099606037139893, 6.124634742736816], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
