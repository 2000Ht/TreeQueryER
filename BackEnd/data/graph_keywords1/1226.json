However, traditional blockchain explorers mostly present transaction information in textual and tabular forms. Such forms make understanding cryptocurrency transaction mechanisms difficult for novice users (NUsers). They are also insufficiently informative for experienced users (EUsers) to recognize advanced transaction information. This study introduces a new online cryptocurrency transaction data viewing tool called SilkViser. Guided by detailed scenario and requirement analyses, we create a series of appreciating visualization designs, such as paper ledger-inspired block and blockchain visualizations and ancient copper coin-inspired transaction visualizations, to help users understand cryptocurrency transaction mechanisms and recognize advanced transaction information. We also provide a set of lightweight interactions to facilitate easy and free data exploration. Moreover, a controlled user study is conducted to quantitatively evaluate the usability and effectiveness of SilkViser. Results indicate that SilkViser can satisfy the requirements of NUsers and EUsers. Our visualization designs can compensate for the inexperience of NUsers in data viewing and attract potential users to participate in cryptocurrency transactions.", "keywords": "visualization,visual analytics,blockchain,cryptocurrency,interactive interface", "link": "http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/VAST50239.2020.00014", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2017.2744098,10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598831,10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865021,10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934208,10.1109/tvcg.2018.2865020,10.1109/tvcg.2019.2934655,10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864814,10.1109/tvcg.2018.2864503"], "wos": 0, "children": [], "len": 1}, "index": 1226, "embedding": [0.21388837695121765, -0.2650621831417084, -0.6033696532249451, -1.985162615776062, -0.43504494428634644, 0.16650904715061188, -0.7643030881881714, -0.7522649765014648, 0.5190326571464539, -0.7969930768013, 1.1863764524459839, -1.0923718214035034, -0.15792734920978546, -0.5430574417114258, 0.8990320563316345, -0.5318171381950378, 0.2636549770832062, 0.06589167565107346, 0.626735508441925, -0.5766514539718628, -0.06630208343267441, -0.6124352812767029, -0.2062615603208542, -0.15392345190048218, -2.343374252319336, 0.05785536766052246, 0.012115567922592163, 0.2964092195034027, -0.5880303382873535, 1.2287763357162476, 0.24104945361614227, -0.13733388483524323], "projection": [2.2496306896209717, 2.4337830543518066], "size": 1, "height": 1, "width": 1}
