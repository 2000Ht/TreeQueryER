The objective is to minimize the displacement of the rectangles. We call this problem Minimum-Displacement Overlap Removal (mdor). Our interest in this problem is motivated by the application of displaying metadata of archaeological sites. Because most existing overlap removal algorithms are not designed to minimize displacement while preserving orthogonal order, we present and compare several approaches which are tailored to our particular usecase. We introduce a new overlap removal heuristic which we call reArrange. Although conceptually simple, it is very effective in removing the overlap while keeping the displacement small. Furthermore, we propose an additional procedure to repair the orthogonal order after every iteration, with which we extend both our new heuristic and PRISM, a widely used overlap removal algorithm. We compare the performance of both approaches with and without this order repair method. The experimental results indicate that reArrange is very effective for heterogeneous input data where the overlap is concentrated in few dense regions.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13199", "refList": ["10.7183/0002-7316.80.2.332", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03106.x", "10.1109/pacificvis.2013.6596123", "10.1007/978-3-642-00219-9\\_20", "10.1007/s10816-014-9211-1", "10.1023/a:1022371615202", "10.1006/jvlc.1995.1010", "10.1109/tvcg.2009.171", "10.1109/tvcg.2010.175", "10.7183/0002-7316.80.3.530"], "wos": 1, "children": [{"doi": "10.1111/cgf.13722", "year": "2019", "title": "Efficient Optimal Overlap Removal: Algorithms and Experiments", "conferenceName": "EuroVis", "authors": "Wouter Meulemans", "citationCount": "0", "affiliation": "Meulemans, W (Corresponding Author), TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands.\nMeulemans, W., TU Eindhoven, Eindhoven, Netherlands.", "countries": "Netherlands", "abstract": "Motivated by visualizing spatial data using proportional symbols, we study the following problem: given a set of overlapping squares of varying sizes, minimally displace the squares as to remove the overlap while maintaining the orthogonal order on their centers. Though this problem is NP-hard, we show that rotating the squares by 45 degrees into diamonds allows for a linear or convex quadratic program. It is thus efficiently solvable even for relatively large instances. This positive result and the flexibility offered by constraint programming allow us to study various trade-offs for overlap removal. Specifically, we model and evaluate through computational experiments the relations between displacement, scale and order constraints for static data, and between displacement and temporal coherence for time-varying data. Finally, we also explore the generalization of our methodology to other shapes.", "keywords": "", "link": "https://doi.org/10.1111/cgf.13722", "refList": ["10.1109/tvcg.2015.2424878", "10.1109/tvcg.2008.165", "10.1111/j.1467-8659.2012.03106.x", "10.1109/pacificvis.2013.6596123", "10.1109/tvcg.2014.2346754", "10.1016/s0925-7721(99)00005-x", "10.1137/s0097539702402676", "10.1023/a:1022371615202", "10.1109/tvcg.2016.2598542", "10.1111/cgf.13199", "10.1007/s00453-009-9281-8", "10.1016/j.dam.2004.02.018", "10.1016/0012-365x(90)90358-o", "10.1137/0405033", "10.1109/sibgrapi.2013.25", "10.1142/s0218195915500077"], "wos": 1, "children": [], "len": 1}], "len": 3}, "index": 1417, "embedding": [0.7673709392547607, -0.10732287913560867, -0.9669491052627563, 1.0189435482025146, 0.1926487684249878, 0.16650904715061188, -0.6826844215393066, 0.5610224604606628, 0.9997519850730896, 0.029673200100660324, 0.6614671945571899, -0.16715572774410248, 0.31176432967185974, -0.04558064043521881, -0.7502163648605347, -0.4591163694858551, 0.12535227835178375, 0.06402745097875595, -0.22367407381534576, 0.8270062804222107, -0.06630208343267441, -0.6541746258735657, -0.5825291275978088, -0.13563132286071777, -1.501523733139038, 0.4004032611846924, -0.5670700073242188, -0.18801918625831604, 0.5142872333526611, -1.4487004280090332, -0.11067577451467514, -0.36555296182632446], "projection": [-0.4265391528606415, 6.554810047149658], "size": 2, "height": 2, "width": 1}
